Benton. The appointment of Col. Ben\\nton to the office of Major General, and his subse\\nquent refusal to accept the appointment, has\\ncaused much remark and speculation. His inor\\ndinate ambition, grasping at the whole command\\nof the armies of the country, with the power of\\ndeciding upon war or peace, and his equally in\\nordinate vanity, have been made alike conspicu\\nous by this event. The Baltimore correspondent\\nof the Boston Atlas, make the following remarks\\nupon the subject:\\nYou see that Major General Benton has backed\\nout! He insisted that he should have the whole\\nconduct of the Mexican war confided to him —\\nthat the negotiation for peace should be under his\\ncontrol —and that he should go forth from Wash\\nington with all the power the President could\\nconfer in him. Mr. Polk quailed under these ex\\ntraordinary demands—he hesitated—equivocated,\\nindeed, as is his wont—and then said he would\\nconsult the Cabinet. They were consulted, and\\nthey were unwilling to take the responsibility of\\nrecommending all that Gen Benton insisted he\\nshould have. Then caine a storm. The new\\nMajor General attacked Mr. Marcy in his office,\\nand those who saw Mr. Benton as he marched—\\nin cocked hat and with arms folded—up Pennsyl\\nvania Avenue, say it was military in the highest\\ndegree. Poor Mr. Marcy was confounded with\\nthe manner of his entrance into the war office,\\nand they say has not recovered from the conster\\nnation into which he was thrown, by what may\\nbe called a military charge, Major General Ben\\nton made upon him. And yet this was nothing\\nlike the entrance into the White House !\\nThe charge of Gen. Worth on the Bishop’s\\nPalace, at Monterey, was nothing, as a military\\ndisplay, compared to it. The august air, the\\nmeasured tread, the cocked hat, and the arms\\ncrossed on the breast, were all perfect in them\\nselves, and the entrance across the yard, through\\nthe vestibule and up the winding stars, sho wed\\na singleness and a fixedness of purpose, which\\nevinced the highest military skill. It will not\\ndo, after this, to question Mr Benton’s military\\ntactics; and though ho has ceased to be a Major\\nGeneral, and sunk down into “ plain Master Ben\\nton,” somebody must get out a picture of his\\nmarch into the White House ; and it it have the\\neffect of frightening the Mexicans only half as\\nmuch as it did Mr. Polk, the war may thencefor\\nward be considered at an end I\\nBut, coming back to the every day view of\\nthis affair, was there ever such an absurd scheme\\nundertaken by any government, as was this ol\\nmaking Mr. Benton Lieutenant General of the\\nUnited States Army, and Minister Plenipoten\\ntiary and Commissioner Extraordinary to Mexi\\nco .’ A man so vain that he can scarcely retrain\\nfrom speaking of his self-sufficiency for all things,\\non all occasions—of temper so uneven, that no\\nman feels sale of his friendship tor an hour, and\\nof spirits so uncompromising, that for whatever\\nhe may have suggested, he will cavil tor the\\nmost immaterial part as for the most material—\\nwhose whole spirit is so uncompromising that\\nthere is no accommodating it—how is it possible\\nfor such a man to accomplish any thing in bring\\ning about a peace with such a nation as Mexico,\\nwhere personal pride is their distinguishing and\\nhereditary characteristic ? We may hope, now\\nthat we‘have got clear of Mr. Benton, that Mr.\\nPolk will fall upon some other person, whose\\ngood sense and honorable desire to see the.differ\\neuces between the two countries accommodated,\\nmay secure us a peace—a peace honorable to\\nMexico as well as to ourselves, and stay the shed\\nding of blood, ana stop the fearful waste of blood\\nwhich is now going on.\\nEFThe Baltimore Patriot says: We hear from\\ngentlemen who were at Washington, Monday,\\nthat there is much dissatisfaction felt in the War\\nDepartment at the manner in which Major Gen\\neral Benton bore himself. Mr. Marcy was real\\nly at a loss how to conduct himself towards the\\n“august personage,” and even Mr. Polk could ill\\nconceal his uneasiness whenever the newiy made\\nGeneral entered the White House. Those who\\nhave seen him “marching” along Pennsylvania\\navenue, says it is a * sight” which would justily\\nall who are curious in such things to go to Wash\\nington to see. The “swagger,” the strut of con\\nquence, the patronizing air, and the grand dig\\nnity which are all blended in him, show that he\\nfeels he has united in his person all the “powers”\\nand all the “airs ” which belong or attach to a\\nhigh plenipotentiary. The Mexican Generals\\nhave a high reputution in such things, but from\\nwhat is said, it is very certain that Major Gener\\nal Benton is a match for them in all that consti\\ntutes pomposity. An interview between him and\\nAmpudia would be a rare sight.\\nA letter says: “You must not be surprised if\\nthere is a ‘fla e up’ between Gen. Benton and Mr\\nPolk. The former acts as it he were the Presi\\ndent, and the latter seems to be afraid of crossing\\nhim in any thing. *1 must have full powers, sir.\\nMy plan requires it, sir, and it must be carried\\nout just as it is set down.’ This is what is report\\ned the new Major General says to the President\\nand all other functionaries, and unless they all\\nyield to him, there is no getting along with him.\\nA Paradise for Thieves.—The St. Louis\\nRepublican has a correspondent in Mexico who\\nfurnishes from Saltillo, the following paragraph.\\nThe penitentiary at this place, containing about\\n70 convicts, is a gay, jolly place; the prisoners\\nare all well dressed playing cards, singing, danc\\ning and enjoying life in apparent indolence.\\nAnother City.—One of the articles in the\\nwarrant tor the annual town meeting in Lynn is\\n“to see if the town will vote to apply to the Leg\\nislature tor a city character!”\\nCambridge.—James D. Green, Esq. was\\non Thursday, re-elected Mayor of the city of\\nCambridge.\\nLoss of the British steamer Tweed.—\\nWe give some additional particulars, from the\\nN. Orleans Picayune, of the reported loss of the\\nTweed :\\nThere were fifty-five passengerson the Tweed,\\n•nd the officers and crew made seventy-five\\nihore. About sixty in all were drowned, but\\nthe account does not designate to which class\\nthey belonged, nor are any names mentioned.\\nThis account was derived from the supercargo\\not the vessel, who, with nine men, was saved, in\\n• boat belonging to the Tweed, and had arrived\\nat Sisal.\\nThe Tweed had, 1170 flask* ot quicksilver on\\nfiosfd, inti other merchandise.\\njttaaaacjiusfttß 3Lcgl«tatme.\\nSaturday, March 13.\\nSenate.

Tue Washington correspondent of the\\nNew York Express says—“ that Mr Benton, the late\\nMajor General, his addressed a circular to the members\\nof the twenty ninth Congress, giving the co r> spnudunce\\nbetween himself, the President of the United States, and\\nthe Adjutant General, growing out of the commission\\ntendered Mr. Benton as Major General. Mr. Polk re\\nplies to Mr, Benton\\'s application to be placed in com\\nmand of the army in with the declaration, that\\nhaving searched the laws of the United States for prece\\ndent or authority, he finds none which will allow him to\\nplace Colonel Bemon in such command. Th’S is given\\nas, and appears to be the true cause of not jaccepting\\nMr. Benton’s proposition. Mr. Benton responds to this\\nwith all due courtesy and kindness, by iuforiiing the\\nPresident that he has sent in his resignation to the Ad\\njutant General, Jones, in order that there might be no\\nhindrance to the immediate appointment of a successor\\nto take his place ” This is dated on Tuesday.\\nEF We request the attention of our readers to the\\nnotice ol the beaut ful Exhibition, at Brinley Hall.

House of Representatives, iu a discussion of the sub\\nject of our Fore\\'gu Relations, “Some how or other\\nFrance has twisted a knot about our necks, which can\\nnot be unloosed ; it must be cut.” What point of argu\\nment was based on this proposition, or what inference\\nwan deduced from the premises, memory does not recal.\\n* * * However that might be, or whatever\\nthe facts might be, it matters but little now. All we are\\nconcerned to consider is, the application of the text, sub\\nstituting slavery for France, to the present stale of our\\ndomestic lelations.\\nFrom time out of mind to this generation, our South\\nern task masters nave been riding over our backs rough\\nshod, and noosing us about at will, with scarcely a note\\nof remonstrance or word of complaint. It is true when\\nMissouri was admitted into the Union—when that fa\\nmous and fatal compromise was achieved—a manly re\\nsistance to the slavery clause in the constitution of the\\nnew State, was made by many Northern members of\\nCongress, by all the Connecticut delegation, and a large\\nmajority of members from all the tree States. For\\nweeks tire question was discussed with ability and\\nwarmth, the balance preponderating in favor of Free\\ndom, and the constitution of Missouri would have been\\nfinally rejected, despite the blustering threats of dissolu\\nlion, so freely thrown out by Southern members, hut lor\\nthe defection ol some No. them doughfaces, as John\\nRandolph appropriately termed them. Some wer -\\nfrightened out of their propriety by \\'be bugbear threat\\nof dissolution. Others thought n would be undemocrat\\nic to oppose a measure so jirgemiv pressed b» the r\\nSoulht rn brethren ; and a few were detected in the\\ngame ot log-rolling. Ma-sarhusetts was disgraced in\\nth- vo\\'csof three of her repress ntatn’es, one from the\\nWestern part ot the Stale, one from the Eastern part,\\nana one from Cunibei land District Maine. When the\\nfinal vote was taken, Mr Randolph fixed his searching\\neyes on the member from Portland, and exclaimed, “we\\nccept the treason, but detest the traitor.” It will be\\nrecollected that Maine, having previously agreed on the\\ntemrs ol separation from Massachusetts proper, applied\\nat this same session of Congress, in 1820- 21, lor ad.nis\\nlion into the Union ; and some over zealous advocates\\nof its early admission, had been betrayed into the lolly\\nof voting m favor of Missouri, slavery and all. for the\\nsake of a quid pro quo. Hence the wilheiiug rebukv of\\nMr Randolph. The way in which this trio of •• dough\\nfaces \" have been neglec ed ai d relinked by their con\\nsliiueiits for twenty six years, should be a caution to\\nsome modern re reams iu the same position.

He was a schcU\\ner of no mean accomplishments, a man possessing\\nan unusual share ot varied and practical know\\nledge, of great wealth, of dignified manners and\\ncommanding person, all of which were made to\\nminister to an active benevolence in evfry de\\npartment of Christian reform. His exertions in\\nthe cause of humanity took a wide range. The\\nreformation of prison discipline—the modification\\nand humanization of the criminal code—the dif\\nfusion of general education—the distribution of\\nthe Scriptures—the cause of universal peace—\\nthe promotion of temperance—the improvement\\nof the poor laws—the abolition of the slave trade\\nand of slavery,—all found in him a steady, ac\\ntive, able and munificent friend. He was the\\nearly advocate of West India emancipation, and\\nshared in the counsels and labors of its first pa\\ntrons, Clarkson, Wilberforce, Buxton, Brougham,\\nMclntosh, Macaulay, Stephen, Suffield, Sturge,\\nand their associates. As early as 1824, he caiis\\nod a public meeting to be convened in the Coun\\nty of Norfolk, where he resided, over which the\\nHigh Sheriff presided, and on which occasion he\\ndelivered an able speech ; and in opposition to\\nsome of the nobility of the shire, procured a pe\\ntition to be adopted calling upon Parliament for\\n“the immediate mitigation, and with as little de\\nlay as possible, the final and entire abolition of\\nBi itish and Colonial Slavery.” The same year\\nhe attended and addressed a general meeting of\\nthe friends ot the cause in Freemason\\'s Hall,\\nLondon, at which Wilberforce, Mclntosh, Bi oug\\nham, Buxton, Denman, and Lushington, were\\nhis associates. Although in the early p.ut of his\\ncareer, he advocated the doctrine ol gradual\\nemancipation, as did all the other friends of the\\ncause, yet he was found among the first to adopt\\nthe grand principle, that “immediate and uncon\\nditional abolition is the right of the slave and the\\nduty ot the master,”—which ever after was the\\nrallying cry of British Abolitionists. During the\\nexci’ing and eventful years from 1830 to 1834,.\\nwinch immediately preceded and resulted in die\\nabolition of slavery, and the substitution therefor\\not the apprenticeship, Mr. Gurney was ever lore\\nmost with tongue, pen and purse, to carry for\\nward the work. VV hen the friends ot the slave\\nsaw that the opcation ot the new system was\\ncruelly oppressive to the negroes, and was but\\nlittle belter than slivery under a milder name,\\nour deceased tiiend buckled on his armor again,\\nand, joining the b .nd led by Joseph Sturge, broke\\nground against it an I demanded its total demoli\\ntion. And, alter a brief, but severe struggle, he\\nhad the gratification of seeing complete freedom\\ngranted to the West India bondmen, on the first\\nof August, 1841. The warm heart and enquir\\ning mind of Mr. Gurney piompted him to visit\\nthe objects ot his solicitude iu their own sea gut\\nhotues, and witness with his own ejes “the hor\\nrors ol abolition.” Accordingly, he spent the\\nwinter ot 1839 in visiting the freedmen ol the\\nvarious West India Islands. Returning to Eu\\nrope, he took this country in his way, and spent\\nthe Spring and Summer momhs ot 1840 in trav\\nelling thii\\'iigh the Unit.d States, preaching to\\ncongregations in the cities and laige towns, and\\nholding private consultations with influential\\nslaveholders and abolitionists, li was during this\\ntour that he published his little volume ol “ Fa\\nmiliar and Friendly letters to Heqry Clay, ot\\nKentucky,” desciibing the beneficial results\\nwhich had followed emancipa i r in the West In\\ndies, and uruing the adoption of the same course\\nin regard to American Slav. ry. Af\\'er hisreturn\\nto England, he travelled on t ie Continent ot Eu\\nrope, visiting France, Holland, Denmark and\\nSweeden, at various periods, and urging upon\\nl he soveieiins a> d leading statesmen of those\\ncountries the wis o n and duty ot abolishing their\\ncolonial slavery. In one of these visits, in 1842,\\nwe believe, he was accompanied by his disting\\nuished sister, Mrs. Fry ; and in addition to the\\narm slavery purposes ot their tour, they spent\\nmuch time in promoting the object which during\\nher remarkable lite, was so near her heart ex\\nploring the prisons of the old world, and admin\\nistering instruction and consolation to the prison\\ners.\\nMr. Gurney’s last visit to the continent, was,\\nwe believe, in 1844. The results ol his labors\\nare seen iu the agitation ot the abolition cause in\\nnearly all the governments of Europe which hold\\nColonial slaves. But we have given a very im\\nperfect sketch of .the philanthropic labors ot this\\nexcellent man ; ‘br. though he was a prominent\\nactor in the anti-slavery conflicts, his hand was\\nnever withdrawn from those other humane enter\\nprises which enlisted his youthful energies. Ev\\nery Rood cause, and especially every reform\\nwhich tended to elevate and improve the depress\\ned classes of his country men, found in him a con\\nstatit advocate Nor was lie fess distinguished\\nfor his private and home charities, than for his\\nmore public and imposing labors. He fed the\\nfiunm y and clothed the naked at hi* own door —\\nHi* princely wealth he distributed with a liberal\\nhand in works of charity and mercy. His catho\\nlic spirit, and. though a Friend in doctrine, garb\\nand speech, his fieedom from sect, i inn bigotry,\\nendeared him to Christians of all\\nit is doubled whether he had an enemy in hi* na\\ntive country. The remains of this beautiful\\nspecimen of the fine Christian gentleman were\\nattended to (heir final resting place by the larg.\\nest concourse of sympathizing and admiring\\nfriends which ever convened on any similar oc\\ncasion in the county of Norfolk Emancipator.\\nMilitary Appointments.
