SHASTA, CAL., SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1853.
THE SHASTA COURIER.
The Ten Hour System.
Mr. Meredith has presented a bill iu the Le
gislature for the protection of the workingman,
declaring that ten hours shall be the legal extent
of a day’s labor. The ten hour system is cer
tainly a very great impiovemeut upon the old
plan of laboring fourteen and sixteen hours per
day, saving as it does a vast amount ol human
suffering and human life. Nevertheless we are
convinced, by personal experience and obser
vation, that it maybe improved upon—that it
does not go quite far enough. Every working
man knows of himself that eight hours out ol the
twenty-four appropriated to labor arc enough to
be thus applied, injustice to all parties. We
are persuaded that an eight instead ol a ten hour
sytem, would prove alike beneficial to the
workingman and his employer. Men know
ing that a day’s work is to continue but eight
hours, will do more in that time, in nine cases
out of ten, than under the ten hour rule. The
miners have long since made this discovery,
and hence the rule obtains among them every
where to devote but about eight hours each day
to mining.
The workingman has always labored too
long for bis own good. He has had literally to
grub his way through the world. It is proverbial
that too much work and too little play make
.lack a dull boy. It is the duty ol our legislators
to pass laws securing to all classes every facility
and opportunity for the acquirement of knowl
edge. To be poor is a sufficient curse of itself;
do not make it the means of fastening a still
greater upon the bead of its hapless possessor—
that of ignorance.
Legislators have too long legislated for capi
talists—they have too long neglected the work
ingman. California is emphatically the work
ingman’s Stati 1 . Here labor is more respected
and better paid for than any where else on the
face of the earth. How peculiar y appropriate
then fur her Legislature to take the lead in this
matter, and still farther elevate, as well as alle
viate, the position of nine-tenths of her people—
the workingmen.
The Legislature.
The following summary of work performed
by our Legislature up to the 4th iust., together
with the cost thereof, we take from the corres
pondence of the San Francisco Ih-rnl/L There
is certainly no room for complaint as to the mere
number and cost of the laws passed and propos
ed. If they only prove beneficial to the interests
of the State at largo, we for one will not accuse
them of either extravagance or laggardness :
From the opening of the session to the 4di
of March—two months —the pay of Senators
amounted to $19,110. That of oQicers and at
taches (strati “e as it may seem) to an equal
sum, say 10.040. Fay of Assemblymen, $44,-
00 1. Officers Are., 20.000. Mileage of members,
$13,93, and Fruiter’s accounts, thus far audited,
$J5,000 —making a total, independent of the
numerous incidenta l expenses of stationery,fuel,
pay oi witnesses, Are., of $143,0-’>B. The cur
rent expenses, independent of printing and
mileage, according to the ab-.ve data, are,
therefore, upwards of SI7OO per dav, or a loss
of that much to the State for every idle day,
the number of which may be reckoned at
something less than one-half of the whole num
ber.
As a return for this, eighty-eight bills have
been introduced into the Senate, of which
twenty have been finally disposed of. In the
Assembly one hundred and eighteen have been
introduced, and about twenty-six passed. Be
sides these, twenty-one joint and concurrent
resolutions have been enacted. In the Senate
fifty-nine resolutions, and in the Assembly
about the same number have been adopted.
Thus, about forty-six bills have been passed,
and one hundred and sixty remain to be dis
posed of—among which are all the prominent
and impoit.int measures of the season—those
passed into laws being, in comparison, of little
importance.
To complete the work already carried out,
without the introduction of additional business,
it is estimated by some of the officers and
members, will require the strictest and most
laborious attention of both branches, night and
day, until the ilOib of April; and, at the rate of
which business has been and is now, dispatched,
until the Ist of June.
From the above data the curious may calcu
late, pretty nearly, what is likely to be the cost
of the laws now being manufactured for the
benefit of the people.
The Fisheries. — The Democratic State Jour
nal publishes an interesting article on the extent
and importance of the Sacramento fisheries, from
which we extract the following:
*• There are four hundred boats on the Sacra
mento river. Each boat lias two men and one
gill net. The boats at $l3O each are valued at
SOO,OOO. The nets at $-200 each at SBO,OOO.
Besides their 00 hauling seines valued at S3OO
each, making $(>.000. The fishing season lasts
from the first of February to the first of August,
during which time the estimated average of
each boat per day is S3O. or an aggregate of
SIO,OOO. The hauling seines yield SIOO each
per day, or SO,OOO in the aggregate. The fish
thus caught supply the markets of Sacramento,
Sail Francisco and Marysville, as well as all the
mining towns within sixty or seventy miles dis
tant ; and sometimes as high as 0000 lbs are sent
to one order. Of the whole amount caught last
year one-fourth was cured in salt, the remainder
going to supply the current demand. The
largest market for Salmon at present is Sail
Francisco. The amount daily shipped there is
from five to six thousand pounds, which will be
increased as the season advances ”
The Army or Japan. — A writer in the last
Edinburg Review, says that the military force
of Japan consists, by the latest accounts, of 300,-
000 infantry, and 30,000 cavahy, and that the
soldiers are careless of danger and indifferent
to life. When one combatant fills, another will
step into his place; and another, and another,
as if their object was to exhaust the tire of their
enemies and then overpower them by sheer
numbers. This would be called a display of
courage in Christians, but in pagans we suppose
it only argues stupidity.
From the San Joaquin Republican.
Chide Mildly the Krrin|f
BT MAJOR G. W. PATTEN, U. S. ARMT.
Chide mildly the erring !
Kind language endears.
Grief follows the sinful—
Add not to their tears.
Avoid with reproaches
Fresh pain to bestow.
The heart which is stricken
Needs never a blow.
Chide mildly the erring!
Blame gently their fall,
If strength were but humau,
How weakly were all.
What marvel the pilgrim
Should wander astray.
When tempests so shadow
Life’s wearisome way!
Chide mildly the erring !
Rebuke them with care,
Compared with the perfect,
The best might despair;
We all have some failing,
We all are unwise,
And the light which redeems us,
Must shine from the skies.
Fort Miller, Feb. 15, 1853.
The Benicia Female Seminary.
This institution, being cramped for the want
of funds, recently petitioned the Legislature for
an appropriation of aid and comfort from the
coffers of the State. The petition—said to have
been written by a young lady of Benicia—was
referred to the committee on education. That
committee —the lions. Fairfax, Flower and
Moore, —being actuated by a spirit of the most
chivalrous gallantry, and a thorough conviction
of the great importance of the matter, made the
following clear and satisfactory report:
The Committee on Education, to whom was
referred a memorial of the Trustees of the Beni
cia Female Seminary asking for an appropria
tion, beg leave to report: That they have pe
rused that document with deep interest, and
have considered the subject it treats of with feel
ings more easily imagined than described. The
appeal contained therein to the “chivalrous
members of our body, many of whom belong to
the best families in America,” emanating as it
did, by proxy, from the fair sex, was a plumper
that at once had a confusing effect upon the feel
ings of your committee. However, gallantry
soon restored the equanimity of your committee,
and they proceeded to consider with due atten
tion ami delicacy the question presented, “ Is a
finished education necessary to the accomplish
ment of a California Lady ?” &c.
Your committee unanimously agreed that the
fair daughters of California are infinitely more
precious and deserving of protection than all the
golden treasures that lie imbedded within her
mountains, and that therefore it is a sacred duty
on the part of the State to extend them a kind
protection in their tender years, and provide the
means of finishing and polishing their moral and
mental education. As is most truthfully set
lorth iu the memorial, the duty will hereafter
devolve upon these fair ones to rear the future
heroes and statesmen of this brilliant State, and
it is the part of a provident and prudent legis
lature to provide that no advantages should be
withheld in the rearing and culture of the afore
said future pillars of the State
The memorial itself is characterised by this
prudence and foresight, in the expression of the
expression of the belief that rii h endowments
will be made by wealthy persons dying iu Cali
fornia. Your committee earnestly join iu the
hope that some benevolent individual will, at an
early < ay, shuffle off this mortal coil, and thus
leave his name to posterity, and his fortune to
the Benicia Female Seminary.
Your committee consider the constitutional
objection as of no moment whatever. When the
behests of woman are to be attended to, the con
stitution must yield. The action of the framers
of the constitution in excluding female semina
ries from the benefits of the school fund, adds
additional evidence of the defect of that instru
ment, and the necessity of its revision. Its fra
mers certainly did not desire to have mothers,
wives, sisters or other female relations.
Your committee believe that the daughters of
California should be made worthy and agreeable
companions for her accomplished sons, and there
fore recommend some action be taken by the
House in compliance with the prayer of the me
morialists. CHAS. FAIRFAX. Chairman.
Party. —DTsrueli, late England’s Chancellor
of the Exchequer, ina recent speech in the House
of Commons, made the following eminently just
remarks on party;
“When parties are balanced —when a govern
ment cannot pass its measures—the highest prin
ciple of public life, I lie most important dogmas
of politics degenerate info party questions.
“ Look at this question of direct taxation, the
most important question of the day. It is a
question which must sooner or later force itself
upon everybody’s attention; and I see before
me many who 1 know sympathise, as far as that
important principle is concerned, with the poli
cy of the government. Well, direct tuxes, al
though applied with wisdom, temperance and
prudence, become party question. Talk of ad
ministrative reform! Talk of issuing commis
sions to inquire into our cockyards ! Why, if 1
were, which is not impossible, by intense labor
to bring forward a scheme which might save a
million to this country, administrative reform
would be a party question to-morrow. Yes, 1
know what 1 have to face. I have to face a coa
lition.
“ The combination may be successful. A co
alition has before this been successful. Butcoa
litious, although successful, have always found
this, that their triumph has been very brief.
[Loud cheers.] This I know, that England has
not loved coalitions. I appeal from the coali
tion to that public opinion which governs this
country —to that public opinion whose wise and
irresistable influence can control even the de
crees of Parliament, and without whose support
the most august and ancient institutions are but
the baseless fabric of a vision.”
A ginger in the northern corner of lowa,
recently dislocated his jaw in attempting to sing
*• high B.” It appears that there was u contest
between the victim and a rival teacher, as to
which should be employed to teach a certain
singing school, and the former made such despe
rate efforts to astonish the natives, as led to the
lamentable result above mentioned —but he got
the school.

NUMBER 3.
[communicated.]
Society in California,
By its influence on private character has been
the fruitful source of great lamentation. Wives,
sons, sisteis and brothers, in the Eastern Stales
have sorrowed deeply over the wreck of char
acter and affection which has come to their
knowledge, and invaded their once happy circle.
Many opinions have prevailed concerning the
cause and cure for this state of things. Many
have hailed the advent of the ladies as the in
struments designed to work a reformation in
men’s habits and modes of life.
But the ladies have come to our shame and
disgrace. They have been a blotch and a scab
on the face of society. \t is not these ladies that
we need, but women, Christian women, virtuous
wives and mothers, with all the sanctity and the
endearments of the home influence. Wives, sis
ters and sweethearts here would have a powerful
influence in bringing about that change in so
ciety so devoutly wished by every one who ex
pects to find a home in the State of California.
11 then we wish to make society what it ought
to be. let us, by all means in our power, encour
age those families who are already here, and
make them teel that we now have many, and
soon will have all the peculiar institutions which
makes home desirable. And thus let us teach
them to look upon this land, not only as their
present abiding place, but as their future, yea,
their present home.
How far are we from that now? How many
sights and sounds do our families meet with
daily, which force them to make unfavorable
comparasons with their former places of resi
dence. Do we wish these families to tarry
among us ? Then must, we exert ourselves to
do away with many ot these unpleasant scenes,
which are now so frequent and so annoying.
More than that, we must exert such an mflu
ence on them that they may send to the East
favorable reports of the state of society in this
land, and invite their uncles and their cousins to
settle near them.
Slowly hut surely will this land he filled up
with families. The character and stability < f
those yet to dwell among us will depend much
upon the position and influence of those already
here. Many a man is now ready to send for Id's
family, who would not consent two years ago
to subject them to the influence then prevailing
in the vicinity where he lived.
Come then, ye men who would be glad to en
joy Acre all the delights of home, unite your efforts
with the families already here, to make society
just what you wish it to be when your families
arrive.
I.mlv ts. Wife.
“ The editor of the Providence Journal, who is
considerable of an arhictcr elegauliarum, which
means a man of taste, says this:
We wish the democratic papers would call Mrs
Pierce the irife of the President elect, instead of
his lady. They are legally married, and she is
entitled to the name of wife. Besides it shocks
all our ideas of morality to hear it said that the
President elect of the United States is traveling
around so much with any other woman than his
wife. If any of the democratic papers labor mi
rier the impression that the title of wife is not
grand enough, we can assure them that Black
wood’s Magazine, which is high aristocratic au
thority, has fully endorsed it, in a long and ex
cellent article, the text of which was taken from
a paragraph in this paper.
An anecdote is told of a Scotch shopkeeper
who declined some requestmade by a customer,
‘ Do you know,’ said the customer, ‘that I am
the Bishop’s lady/’ ‘Hoot, woman,’ was the
answer, ‘ I would not do it if ye was his wife,
much less his leddy.’ Lady is a beautiful word
in its place, and female is a proper word in its
place, but either of them employed for wife or
woman is in shocking taste.”
This is all very well, except the charging of a
vulgarism, which is common to our whole so
ciety, upon the democratic papers, which are no
more guilty in the premises than the whig pa
pers and every record of arrivals at the hotels
in the nation. Names are always entered thus:
‘ Mr. Smith and lady,’ or ‘ Mr. Peter Popkins and
lady,’ when, if any body should say,"" Jones and
woman,’ or ‘ Mr. Peter Popkins and woman,’
Jones and Popkins would he turned incontinent
ly out of doors. The practice, however, is con
venient for young gentlemen who travel with
ladies that are not wives.— N. T. Post.
California Chauactkr. —The true state of
society and morals in California is so little known
in the Atlantic States, that when the frequent
accounts of death by violence or destitution, or
the thousand distorted representations of return
ed Californians reach them, they are apt to
imagine that in the rush for gold, the communi
ty have no care or thought for those whd are less
fortunate. In truth, there is not a city in the
world, not excepting the par excellence philan
thropic city of Boston, where the sympathies of
our entire community are so easily and effectual
ly interested in the suffering and destitute. Let
a subscription list for a widow or orphan be
taken through the city by a respectable person,
and it is rare indeed if the claim upon thechari
ties of the benevolent is not cheerfully render
ed. The instances which occur to us as we
write, are numerous, and are suiHcient proofs
of the benevolence of our citizens. Perhaps the
most conspicuous example of this real philanthro
py, is the instantaneous response made to the
appeals of those left houseless and penniless by
the conflagration at Sacramento. Not less than
$15,000 was raised in four days by the mere an
nouncement by the press of this city that sub
scriptions would be received at stated depots,
besides the subscriptions afforded by clothes,
provisions, &c., and the community seemed ac
tuated by a general desire to alleviate the suf
ferings of the Sacramentans. We allude to this
particular instance, that our Atlantic readers
may know that as fur as human sympathies and
all the finer feelings of man’s nature are concern
ed we are not behind them in our efforts to as
sist the unfortunate; with this slight difference,
that the above sums collected and expended for
charitable purposes from a city of 40,000 inhabi
tants, would be the signal tor the J e Deums
and eulogies of the Atlantic press for weeks,
while here the thing was not regarded as of ex
traordiuary note, and would not have been
thought of again but for our casual recurrence
to it. There is, however, one portion of our
population who have not as yet appealed to the
sympathy of the public for support; we allude
to our Chinese population. In looking over the
weekly reports of the city sexton, we find that
the proportion of Chinese burials at the public
expense is exceedingly small. The feeling re
cently agitating the public mind concerning
their immigration, seems to have abated, and
the Celestials, by their habits of order, their in
dustry and intelligence, have now a good name,
not only in the cities but in the mining and agri
cultural districts.-

POOH SAN FMANCiSCU.
If there be ■ lac er people in the world
tbao the San Franciscans where are they ?
Business tneti do not pet around until lo}
a. M., and leave at 8 P. M., while the work
ers, but there are no workers among th se
who can by hook or crook lite without la
bor. The San Fraucu-co Republican gives
this picture of that poor city:
“Probably ten thou.-and able-bodied men
in San Fraucisc wolk only with sufficient
continuity to arert starvation and ptocure
sufficiei t raiu oi to make a decent appear
unce. All uruuud ua we hear complaint*
ol the difficulty ot obtaining agricultural
labor. - bout the fi or thousand drinking
saloons of the city are at all times visible
groups ut men at d lads passing their time
in drunkenness and idleness. A simple
dog fight will bring upon tbes'reets a mul
titude of th,.se bipeds; yet the fatmers
suffer fur want of sufficient help to garner
his harvest, and the employed is the giver
and not the receiver of a favor. A farmer
informed us a day or two sinue that in con
sequence o* - inability to hire pickers, thu
produce of a large strawberry field bad gone
iu waste. Let any one try to procure the
immediate performance of any kind ot work,
and he will begin to get an idea ol the in
creasing pievalence ut an indisposition to
labor. With half.grown lads—who are
cuming up into manhood with no other
capital than their muscle—-the city swarms.
We are sending mmsiuiianes to gentle sav
ages, while the courts and alleys ol our own
city are lull of men whose consciences
might be quickened if the attempt w< re
made in a proper manner. In San Fran
cisco, by some means or other, a greater
multitude of people live only from hand to
mouth than in any other city ut th« same
population »f which we know. Farmers
are offering 82, 83 and even 84 a day tor
able bodied men, yet there arc thousands of
these in San Francisco who would rather
starve than exchange the poisoned bre .th
of our courts and alleys for the | ure air ol
the country ”
Phkdiction. — In lis speech at the New
York meeting, Senator Wilson said:
Mr. Schurz made a prediction the other
night, and he closed with the declaration
that their banners would float over the
dome of the Capitol in a twelvemonth.
Now I will make a prediction here to night,
and I want you to remember i* as lung as
you remember Mr. Schurz's prediction,
and it is this: 'I but if the nominees at
Cincinnati are nut supported by the Demo
cratic party of the country, they will out
have an electoral vote in the Union; that
if they a r e supported by the Democratic
party, we will carry Irom twenty five to
thirty States ot the Union for Grant.—
And 1 want to say another thing. It may
not be very modest to say, but 1 will say it
here. I have looked into the faces cf mure
men at public meetings than any public
man in America, and in more States. 1
think I have son e little knowledge of
public opinion and public men. In 1860
I stated belorethe election how the Slates
would stand, 1 did not miss one. In 1864
I missed none. 1 misled one in IX6B, and
that was the State of New York I did
not fully comprehend the counting powet
of Tammany Hall. Now, gentlemen, the
Republican party has 3,500,000 voters.
'I weuty eight out of the thirty-seven States
on a fair, square, and honest vi le, are
Republican to-day. If there is a com
biuation at Cincinnati, I don’t care on
whom they make it. we will take more
Democratic voles than they will Republi
can. The nominees at Philadelphia, gen
tlemen, will be elected. 1 make that pre
diction here to-night, and I say it to every
man in America that my voice may reach
him through the press. And. gentlemen,
let each one ut us do our whole duty Let
us be as firm as the eternal hills of OUT
country; bat Ictus be kind, concilia
tory. treat our erring frit nds as erring
friends, until after they choose to
take farewell of os and go away, and
then gentlemen, they will be where the
men who h-.ve deserted us in the trials i f
the last twelve years have pot tln-niselves
—out of power and out of the contest of
affairs and proved false and recreant to
there own p..st.
During a class meeting held several years
since by the Methodist brethren of a South
ern village Broth, rJm es went amoi g the
colored (lortion of the congregation.—
Finding there an old man notorious fur bis
endeavor to serve God on the Sabbath and
Satan the reel of the week, he said, “Well,
Brother Dick, I'm glad to see you here.
Haven’t stolen any turkeys since 1 sew you
last Brother Dick?"" “No, no, Brudder
Jones, no turkeys.” “Nor any ckickene.
Brother Dick ?” “No, no, Brudder Junes,
im chickens."" “Ihiukth Loid, Brother
Dick! That's doing well, my brother!""
said Brother Jon a, leaving Brother-Dick,
who immediate y relieved hie overburden
ed conscience by saying to a near neighbor,
with an immense sigh of relief, “Ef be d ■
said ducks, he'd a had me.”
It is not • very easy matter for a man
to serve many masters. Fur instance.
Assemblyman Ellis, of Los Angeles, voted
for the No-F’enee bill is the Legislature,
and the other day < oe of hie constituents
thrashed him for it. Ihe News, jo refer

There is D«t» ttepubjtoao paper » Wjf
tkki hi norm (inakf.
Domesticated Burr aloes—The
Kansas Pacific Railroad Company has made
t proposition to the Government wi ich
Jusy result in • series of experiments tend-
| l, |t toward the utilization of buffaloes.
The proposition is, that the Government
shall join the company in providing enor
muua ‘•corrals” on the reserve lands, fenc
ing nod ditching, so that barriers, impews
able to the buffaloes, should inclose large
tracts in favorable localities, into these
the herds will be driven at the proper
season, and used as shall be die ed best;
that il to say, killed for their meat and
hides, or kept and permitted to breed,
much as domestic cattle are in Texas.
Some experiments have been tried in cross
ing the buffalo with domestic cattle, and
the result is highly satisfactory, a breed of
animals being produced which retains
many of the valuable properties of both
breeds. 'I he auimals are la ge and strong,
the chief objection to them being that no
ordinary fence stops them tor a moment,
and that they love the water so much that
they will swim and spurt in it even when
it is full of flouting ice. '• e have heard
of a Ciiw sol calf whose love fur athletic
exercise Was such that they woulil jump
from a bank ten feet high into deep water,
when there was no easy path close at hand
'I hese personal peculiarities are drawl acks
to the introduction of buffalo blood into
the veins of family pets; hut on the other
hand, when properly cared for, these tni
mals make must delicious beef, and their
hides, when soft-tunned, are a much super
ior to the buffalo robe of commerce as wool
is to shoddy. The present writer saw the
pelt ot the an phibious cow mentioned
obove It was much larger than any
buffalo robe which he ever saw before, was
covered with a mat ot soft, short, curly,
brown hair, there being none of the long,
shaggy hair ordinari y seen. It is thus
seen that there are advantages, as well as
disadvantages, in the | rnposed domestica
tion ; but it is beyond question that it any
u e can be made of the vast herds ot wild
buffaloes, a valuable addition may be made
to the wealth of stuck farmers.
Fortifying—'ihe French people, tak
ing coun.-el by the misfortunes of the past
are encaged in an extensive system of
tortifleation The resources of the Uov
ernn ent seem tube inexhaustible. Fay
ment of the German tudeui'iily goes
steadily on, the army is being thoroughly
recorganized and largely increased, a sei es
of splendid improvements is going on in
the e'ty of Furis. and now the additional
expense isincuned of erecting a magi ificent
system of fortifications. A semi-circular
fortification will extend irom Belfort to
Lyons, and intrenched camps will be plac
ed in it at Belfort, Besancon and Lyons.
Belfort is to become a 6 st class fi.nre.-s,
with detached forts constructed on the
various summits which mark the opening
between the chain of the Vosges and the
Jura mountains. Here ihe camp is to he
large enough to contain two hundred
thousand men Fesancon is to be trans
formed into a fortress, with bastioned
enceinte and detaehe I forts governing the
defiles of the Jura and commanding a
strategic line from Besacou to Belfort.—
At Besancon, the camp, wh ch will be
mainly tor the instruction ot recruits, will
be capable of holding 200,000 men. In
order to avoid the recurrence of any disas
r< r such as forced Bou bak i’s army to fly
into Switzerland, the defiles of the Jura
are to be covered with redoubts and
batteries protecting the retreat of a van
quished army. Dijun is to be fortified,
Langres ""ill be converted into a camp,
and .he whole district ii which Paris stands,
comprising a zon«* 150 miles in e'rcumfer
ence, crowded with immense towns, will be
transformed into one vast citadel, which it
will be impossible to regularly invest.
Wht Some People Remain Poor
Cream is allowed to mold and spoil.
Silver s|i)<oiis are used to scrape kettles
The scrubbing-brush is left in the water.
Bones are burned that would make soup.
Nice bandied knives are thrown into
hot water and spoiled.
Fish cloths are thrown where mice can

Tubs and barrels are left in the sun to dry
and tall apart.
Clothes are left on the line to whip to
peices in the wind.
Pic crust is left to sour, instead of mak
ing a few tarts for lea.
Vegetables are thrown away that would
warm for breakfast.
Dried fruit is not taken care of in season,
and becomes wormy.
Bits of meat are thrown nut that would
make hashed meat or hash.
The cork is left out of the molasses jug,
and the flics take possession.
Pork spoils fir want of salt, and beef be
cause the brine wants scalding.
Coffee, tea, pepper and spicts are left to
stand open and li.se their strength.
Potatoes in tl e cellar grow, and the
epronts are not removed until they become
useless
The flour is sifted in a was efol manner,
and the bread pan left with the dough
ticking to it.
Vinegar is drawn in a *in basin, snd al
b-wed to stand till both basin, and vinegar
era spoiled
Cold paddings are considered good for
nothing, when often they can be steamed
tor the next day.

A MEW AMU IMPORTANT ENTER
PRISE*
The article given below is from a meat
unu ber of the Alta California
The Pacific Submarine Exploring Con*
psnj of N< w York is about to make a rev
elation that may astonish the wot Id It ja
well known that at and off Gold Bluff, oa
the northern shores of California, the see
beach has extensive ranges of golden node
which have been worked for yean and are
now piodncing no small annual crops of
gold, rentalkabie for its purity. 'he sand
is black and it contains titaniterous iron
and visible particles of gold. 1 here was a
rush some years a-o to these new diggings,
which failed of success because they tell
shi rt of extravagant expectations. The
gold was there and provokingly visible.- - '
Hut the tide was great and the period of
low Waterloo short for w rl> ing. Tnen the
wet sand had tc be carted over roads of dry
sand and up the cliffs, and thence miles to
water fur washing out the gold in a crude
way. This does not sut the crowds who
rush to new places, exporting to toil, little
and pick up much. As usual, the back
rush repotted unfavorably, and ever since
people only remember the abandonment—
It was found that the saod giew richer
the furt ier they could peuetrate into the
breaker, and iite-boats that sounded in six
to ten fathoms beyond found the sandy
bottom to he yet richer in gold of temsrk
able brightness It seemed as if the gold
Washed up on the besch ca • e from the e
submarine banks. But it was deemed im
practicable to realize t l e riches covered by
such a depth of moving waters. Some
parties, however, who have made it a life
time study, have succeed iu inspiring cap
italists with faith in their own firm belief
that where gold is in sight the Yankee
hand can reach it. Part-es wl o used the
divii g bell to so good a purpose in remov
ing the submarine rocks at ell Gate, New
York, after a through examination of the
golden sandbanks and the laws of the
ocean movement, have gone into the en-
Klprise with a degree of earnestness that
indica'es unbounded confidence in success.
How they are going to do it and when, may
b> judged by what is to be seen going on
silently and unobserved in our midst. Al
ready a Jiving bell of large capacity is fin
ished near Mission and First streets. It ia
divided into chambers, in one ol which air
condensed to three atmospheres is stored
for the n-e ot the workmen This is for
submarine exploration. A schooner will
be provided with a steam vacum pump, and
an elastic lube say ol 6 inch diameter. Hy
this means, wc know 'hat sands flow up
ward into the vacum chamber in a steady
stream carrying water enough to give them
I mobility This is no new principle, and it
! involves no doubt that one hundred tons
an hour can be so elevated against gravity,
by the pressure of the waters carrying the
sand. As the lighters are loaded they ate
sent ashore for cloriuation, where fuel is
plenty.
May Ist to September Ist the ocean per
mits the work to go on in safely. Alter
that date the company sails with its ap
pointments to the pearl fisheries of the Gulf
of California, kto.vn to be the finest in the
world. There seems to be every reason to
believe that success will attend the inter
esting enterprise. If successful it may add
greatly to the gold product of this coast;
and it certainly will fill the world with ad
miration 01 the wondets of California, and
of the ingenuity, enterprise and persever
ance ol the American people.
The Vai.ue.— The following is the ex
perience of a mechanic concerning the ben
efits of a newspaper:
Ten years ago I lived in a town in Indi
ana. On retaining home one night, lor I
am a carpenter by trade, I saw a little girl
leave my door, sod 1 asked my wife who
she was. She said Mrs. Harris had sent
her after their newspaper, which my wife
had borrowed. As we sat down to tea my
wife said to me by name :
* I wish you would subscribe for the
newspaper ; it is so much comfort to mo
when you are away from home.”
*‘l would like to do so,” said I, “but yon
know I <>we a payment on the h< n-e and
lot. It will be all I can do to meet it.”
She replied : *Tt you will take this pa
per, I will sew for the tailor to pay for it.”
I subscribed fm ihe paper ; it c< me in
due time to rbe shop. While resting one
msm and looking > ver it, I saw and ad-er
tig ment of the county commissioners to lei
a bridge that was to be built. I put in ■
bid for the bridge, and the job was award
ed to me, on which I cleared s3Ul>, which
en bled me to pay lor my house ai d lot
easily, and for the newspaper. If I had
not subscribed for the newspaper 1 would
not have known anything shout tha eon
tra l. and corn'd not have met my payment
on my honse and lot A mechanic never
lusesanyhing by takings rewspaper.

Submitting to Disgrace.
riau Francisco submitted to a
stain upon her honor when ram
pant ruffianism was allowed to run
rough-shod over a respectable con
course of her citizens. Disguise it
as we may, by saying that all
parties iv this are apparently
working for the same end, the in
sult has been placed upon tbe fore
head of the commonwealth, and
hereafter we must expect to be
called a commuuity of cowards,
who do not daro to assert their
rights, unless the Insult Is effaced.
It cannot be done by putting tables
ou Montgomery street, with at
tendants to importune for signa
tures to a paper to be prcseuted to
the Legislature—there is no asser
tion of manhood in that. Tbe
atonement must be made in public
assemblage, with citizens of tbe
claaa who called the first meeting,
with a Chairman of their
own choosing, with Vice
Presidents, iv accordance with
custom, with statesmen and
clergymen aud lawyers and
physicians to deliver addresses:
with privilege for a Senator to
speak without being insulted; free
from insulting and vulgar com
ments on the names of gentlemen
proposed for a Committee—in short,
in keeping with tbe proceedings of
all respectable and orderly meet
ings before tbe advent of tbe boor
who obtruded himself into tbe last
meeting and outraged decency by
hie ill-mannered and disgraceful
behavior. Unless this is done, it
will be impossible to hold public
meetings hereafter, for every rowdy
will feel at liberty to jump upou
the platform, push back tbe speak
ers, tsar up tbe list ef officers, pre
sent his own set of resolutions, per
mit only bia own adherents to de
liver speeches, unless ha shall be
graciously pleased to grant the
privilege to those who will tacitly
acknowledge bia right to the
uaurped throne.
The unparalleled outrage com
mitted by Dennis Kearney and his
ruffians at Plan's Hail, Ilea upon
tha city of San Francisco as a foul
diahonor. We owe it to our past,
our present, and our future, to wipe
out the ""damned spot,"" and redeem
our standing among the civilized
cilieaof America. From whatever
point of view tbe subject is consid
ered, tbe people of the Queen Cily
of the Pacific owe it to tbemseives
to redress the insult. If Kearuy
ism cau overawe popular assem
blies it will proceed to overawe
anythiug it pleases. If successful
in terrorizing our people into sub
mitting to a deprivation of their
right of speech iv lawful assem
blies, It will proceed until its rapa
cious domination will absorb every
right that a freeman ought to have.
Kearneyism will become simply ""a
giant drunk, reeling among the
pillars of the temple of liberty.""
Let this ruffianism be taught, oucs
for all, and speedily, that a meeting
for lawful purposes, properly call
ed, must be free from interference
at any coat. — Alta California.
Monster Musical Festival.
Mr. Sumner \V. Bugbee, of San
Francisco, lias madi arrangements
for a grand musical festival in that
city on the 28th, 29th and 30th of
May, In which the music will he
sent iuto tho interior of the State
hy means of tlie telephone. The
Bulletin thus outlines the entertain
meat:
""The proposition is to procure
several artists of first repute from
the East or Europe, and I o supple
ment them with the entire musical
talent in tlie State. All tbe inte
rior towns and cities will be in
vited to contribute heir best sing
ers. Either Miss Thursby or Mies
Auuie Louise Gary will be engaged
with other vocalists of scarcely less
favor. Mr. Bugbee states that he
has ordered a large musical tele
phone, to connect San Jot/;, Stock
ton aud Sacramento with the con
cert. If success attends the enter
prise, it is proposed lo hold a mu
sical festival each year, alternating
between one of the interior cities
and San Francisco. As Mr. Bugbee
is not in the habit of failing in his
euterprises, the public may count
ou a grand festival early ia May.""
This will be the grandest musical
entertainment ever given ou this
Coast. The Director lias written to
leading musicians iv every part of
the State, and has invited chorusses
from every town. Mr. Louis Lewiu
has the matter in charge here of
securing a delegation of voices
from Los Augeles to the groat fes
tival, and be hopes to succeed in
getting up interest enough among
our amateurs to succeed iv having
us well represented.

AN OPEN LETTER—IT SPEAKS
IFOR ITSELF.
EtOOKfOBT, Mass., April 2, IST"".
Mn. Eihtok:— Having read in your pa
per icpoita of the remarkable cures ol ca
tarrh, I am Induced to tell "" what 1 know
about catarrh,"" and I fancy tbo""snuff""
and ""Inhaling tube"" makers (mere dol
lar grabbers) would be glad if tliey could
omblazou a similar cure In the papers.
For 20 years I suffered with catarrh. Thu
nasal passages became completely closed.
""Snuff,"" ""dust,"" ""ashes,"" ""Inhaling?
tubes,"" and ""sticks"" wouldn't work,
though at Intervals 1 would sniff up the
so-called catarrh snuff, until 1 became a
valuable tester for such medlclneF. I
gradually grew worse, aud vi one can
KOOW hOW much 1 suffered or what B
miserable being I was. My head ached
over my eyes until 1 was confined to my
bed for many successive days, suffering
the most lutense pain, which at one time
lasted continuously for 168 hours. All
sense o( smell and taste go.ie, sight and
hearing Impaired, body shrunken
and weakened nervous system shat
tered nnd constitution broken, and 1 was
hawking and spitting seven-eighths of the
time. 1 prayed lor death lo relieve me of
mv suffering. A favorable notice in your
paper ot Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy In
duced me to purchase a package and use
it with Dr. Tierce's Nasal Douche, which
applies the remedy by hydrostatic pres
sure, the oulv way compatible with com
mon sense. Well, Mr. Editor, it did not
cure me In three-iourths of a second, nor
Inone hour or mouth, but iv less than
eight minutes 1 was relieved, and in
three months entirely cured, and have
remained so over sixteen mouths. While
using tho Catarrh remedy, I used Dr.
Pierces Oolden Medical Discovery to pu
rity my blood and strengthen my stom
ach. I also kept my liver active and
bowels regular by the use of his Pleasant
Purgative Pellets. If my experience will
induce other sufferers lo seek the same
means ot relief, this letter will have an
swered its purpose.
Yours ruiy, S. D. RE MICK.

los angeles daily herald.,['Los Angeles'],1889-05-13,"attend to them. Admiral Kimberly,
with Vice-Consul Blacklock, afterwards
had a conference with Knappe about the
termination of the war, but nothing was
accomplished. , ,
A war scare broke out among Mataata s
men on the night of April 3d. They
were preparing for a review of their forces
in Apia, and it was expected that very
few men would be left in camp. A re
port reached Apia that Tamasese in
tended take advantage of the absence of
so many of Mataafa's men and attack the
camp. Accordingly 350 of Mataafa s war
riors took to the oush about a mile from
Taraasese's fort. They remained in the
vicinity two days, but finding no sign of
hostilities returned to camp.
The Press correspondent interviewed
Tamasese at his camp two weeks ago.
Signs of poverty and destitution were
noticeable on every hand and his men
were suffering for want of proper shelter.
Tamasese said but little about the poli
tical situation, but manifested great in
terest in the shipwrecked sailors and the
reports that more German men-of-war
were on their way here.
Tamaseso's chief adviser, who went to
Washington several years ago and nego
tiated a treaty with the United States,
was present at the interview. He said
he did not think there would be any
more fighting soon, and that Tamasese
was awaiting the result of the Berlin con
ference and expected that the difficulty
would be settled in that way. Ho
declined to say anything in refer
ence to tbe attitude of the Ger
mans toward the Tamasese party
but it was evident that they were tired
of trusting to German assistance, and
would gladly lay down their arms and go
home. Along Tamaseae's fortifications
several brass howitzers are still mounted,
and the natives in the camp are well
armed.
THE lIKRI.IN PAKLEV.
England Playing the Part of Mid
dleman in the Teeter.
London, May 12.—The 7'itnes sayp:
The Berlin Conference has come to an
agreement in regard to the Samoan Land
Commission question and its side issues,
also as to restricting the consulate in the
supply of fire-arms and spirits to the
natives. The election of a King will be
left to the Sarnoans. It is doubtful if
Germany will yield to the tripartite prin
ciple of government as, in the council,
England shows no leaning towards
either side, playing the part of the
""honest broker.""
The Berlin correspondent of the Daily
News says that the Samoan conference
has agreed tbat a neutral zone

THAT CUNNING CRONIN.
Is He Working a Great
Game on the Public?
HE COULD NOT FOOL CORNWELL.
A Chicago ""Times"" Reporter Was
Too Clever to Be Played for
a Soft Sucker.
ai MX lati.d rresi DiEi>Bterie« to the Hxbalh. I
Chicago, May 12.—James J. Cornwell,
a reporter for the Chicago Timet, who is
said by Cronin, in the Toronto interview,
to be the person who introduced the
Doctor to le Caron, the British spy,
denies emphatically that there is any
truth in the assertion. Cornwell says
that he was detailed once to interview
Cronin on some local Irish matter and
that the Doctor subsequently applied to
Cornwell to have published a long article
in which Cronin was made to figure as a
man who was being persecuted in certain
ways en account of his religion and his
nationality. Cornwell returned the
manuscript. Cronin grew very angry at
the result. Otherwise than in these
incidents, Cornwell knows nothing of
Cronin and never heard of Le Caron un
til the latter's appearance as an informer
in London. The man Charles Long, who
ie said to have discovered Cronin in
Toronto, and who ia sending interviews
from there with the Doctor, is the per
son, Cornwell says, through whom
Cronin, while in Chicago, sent the re
jected manuscript mentioued above, aud
through whom the dccument was re
turned to Cronin.
WAS THE TORONTO STORY A FAKE.
New York, May 12.—The Morning
Journal says that a meeting of the Irista
Nationalists, friends of Doctor Cronin,
of Chicago, was held on Sunday
to take stepa towards co-operating with
the Chicago investigators of his
mysterious disappearance. Letters were
read from Cronin's friends in
Chicago and speeches were made, thH
substance of which-declared the belief
of his friends that Cronin had
either been abducted or murdered.
The story from Toronto is not believed ;
many of them thinking it a ""fake.""
A committee was appointed to
prepare a statement of the case
whrch would enable the public to tee tbe
necessity of probing the mat
ter to the bottom. It was
freely stated that developments in
the case would result in exposing one of
the bildest and most startling crimes of
the century.
SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION.
A Cotton Cut so Takes Fire—Tne
Captain's Happy Thought.
Plymouth, May 12.—The steamer
liugia.from New York, May 2d, for Ham
burg, which arrived to-day, reported that
the cotton iv her after-hold had epon
taneouly ignited on the night of the Bth.
The fire was burning fiercely, but was
quenched after five anxious hours, during
whicli time, everything had been got in
readiness to abandon the steamer. Great
fright prevailed among the passengers,
who remained on deck for two days.
Through the efforts to quench the fire,
the cabins were flooded y.uu two-thirds
of the passeiigern 1 baggage was spoiled.
tin of the crew were injured. It is feared
that the steamer's cargo is greatly dam
aged.
After the fire had gained considerable
headway, some of those on board made
preparations to desert the ship, but
were prevented from doing so
by the captain, who threatened them
with his revolver. When the
iron bulkhead doors were opened
tho heat became so intense that many
persons were scorched, and the cotton
bales around the passengers' baggage
took fire. Caskw of lard, which formed a
part of the vessel's cargo, also furnished
fuel for the flames. Hope had
been well nigh abandoned and
the boats had baen lowered to
leave the threatened steamer, when it
occurred to tbe captain to try steam in
stead of Water against tho fire. This
plan was put in operation, and
proved successful. Ti.e passengers
have presented the captain with ar,
address and the crew with various gifts
as evidences of their gratitude and es
teem for their good work in the midst of
tbe awful dangers which encompassed
them all.
A REIUN Or TIiKKOK.
A. Collision Between tne Itaccs In
tne South—Tlie Negroes worsted.
New Orleans, La., May 12.—As a re
sult of the tight between some negroes
and whites iast Tuesday, at Gretna, in
which two men were seriously injured,
trouble has been brewing, and it culmi
nated last night in quite a row.
This morning at 1 o'clock a
fire broke out, in the engine
house of the colored fire company, and
the colored militia's arsenal adjoining
was burned also. A large crowd of
whites and reiroes ghthered, and a dele
gation of the Gretna militia (white) went
to the sceno. Beveral negroes re
fused to leave the burning build
ing until they were in danger, alleging
that they were afraid to meet the armed
whites. When they finally came out, a
fight ensued, and some of the whites
fired, seriously wounding three negroes.
All this time the fire was spreading,
and several houses were de
stroyed, tho flames finally dyiDg out
for want of fuel. During tho eonttasra
tion a large number of white men,
armed with shotguns, rifles and
pistols, congregated around the scene,
and prevonted any of the ne.roes
from coming within 100 yards of tire fire.
After the fire was ever, armed .quads oi
whites scattered around the town and
entered a number of negro cabins, os
tensibly in search of arms.
A reign of terror prevails among the
negroes, and colored women and children
have been leaving Gretna all day for this
city, Liking with them such effects aw
they could carry.
A PKHDIdiAL SON.
Bow He ""Coppcrid"" tlie Old flan
and Bullied Illui.
Chicago, May 12.—A strange dis
jel ure followed, to-night, when it was
t, -unced that Nathan Corwith, Sr.,
on very ill, and that his death war,
to occur at any minute. Years
. <vith was the richer lead mer
i America. The upproach of
' death ""tiiped inquiries which resulted in
6 heretofore unknown story
len descent to poverty.
I'i'ho 8 tp; Won has been that Corwith's
r gigantic failure in business was solely
! I tbe result ol * n ill-timed attempt to cor
. j ncr the lead ripply of the world. As
- now revealed, the teal reason was very
Idifferen' as related in brief,
are, that Corwith's every move in specu
la'ion was being ""coppeied"" with his own
capital by his own son, Gurdon Cor
with, and that, before the crash came,
one million one hundred thousand dol
lars had been withdrawn from the old
man's coffers, and sunk in operations in
which the younger Corwith had become
hopelessly involved. Young Corwith was
at the time a metal broker in New-
York, and induced his father to be
lieve that he had exclusive information
regarding the plans of the French copper
syndicate as to lead. The father was in
poor health, and allowed his son unusual
leeway. Until the actual collapse was
reached, Corwith believed he had an
enormous amount of lead on band and
paid, when the fact was that the lead
purchased had been sold and
the proceeds utterly wiped out by youug
Corwith's operations. Young Corwith
was placed in confinement for a while,
but was afterwards released, and his
father shouldered the loss, making what
ever eettlement was possible.
Tbe Even Strikers.
Berlin, May 12.—About midnight, last
night, a mob set fire to a factory at Lier
enfeld, which consumed Mulbelm and
Dulsberg. The miners at Scholwig
have joined in the strike At Scholwig
a number of pitmen attacked their fore
man with daggers, and be had to flee for
his life. A body of infantry arrived here
at 3 o'clock this morning, when the riot
ers took refuge behind a railroad em
bankment, and fired at the troops. Three
times the rioterß were called upon to dis
perse, but they refused to obey. The
soldiers then fired into the crowd, killing
six persons, one of them being a four
year-old child. A woman was also
wounded. After the firing, the mob dis
persed. The district bristles with troops.
The miners held a meeting at Essen,
which was attended by the Government
officials, who resolved to raise the wages
of the miners, but they firmly declined
to concede eight hour's as a day's labor.

Pidiia of (Ue New Armortd Vessel.
The new vessel is to have a length of
250 feet, with a breadth oi 59 feet and
4,000 tons displacement. She will be
protected by a belt of steel irmor six
teen inches thick over the ongines,
boilers and magazines, and eight inches
thick forward and aft. The specifications
call for 5,400 horse power. Tho Union
Iron Works guaranteed to develop this
power, while Cramp & Sons, the lowest
Didders, avoided the conditions.
There are many features of interest
about the new ctaft. Tne specifications
provided for two ordinary tubular ma
rine boilers of 1,500 horse power. The
remainder of the 5,400 horse power re
quited is to be supplied by coil boilers.
These have beeu tried with great succes i
ou yachts and in a fhodihed form by the
French Government. But their use in
n aval vessels will be largely experimental.
If they come up to expectations, they
will result in a largo saving of space and
weight. The Union Iron Works agreed
to accept the Department's plans and
guarantee retults.
The new vessel will be* a departure in
design from any vessel in the navy, and
will be the most formidable vessel for her
difplacement of any in the world, and
able to cope with any tiling afloat. She
approximates the monitor type, and or
5,000 tons displacement in cruising trim.
When she goes into action, by taking
on water ballast, she sinks until her
deck is but eighteen inches above tlie
water level, thus diminishing the size of
the target exposed to her opponent. The
sides covering the machinery are to be
covered wi'h sixteen inches of armor, be
sides the protectim offered by the coal
bunkers. The bar bet tM con'aining the
gunsare to be of 10-inch steel, aDd the
deck will be of steel two inches tiiick.
She will be 264-feet long, 49 feet, beam,
14). feet drtutiand have a speed of 10
knots. At this speed she can st*am 032
miles. But at ordinary cruising speed
about nine knots) she would travel
2,722 miles without renewing her coal
supply.
Her most remarkable feature will be
the tremendous power of her armament.
On the forward barbette, mounted on a
turntable and manipulated by hydraulic
power, she will carry a sixteen-inch rifle,
weighing 110 tons and forty-nine feet
long, one of the largest guns afloat. Inth«
rear barbotte there will be a twelve-inch
rifle,weighing forty-six and one-half tons.
A fifteen-inch dynamite gun, flit}'
feet long, will project from the bow, and
in other places the vessel will carry six
thirty-three-poundere, three nine-pound
ers, two six-pounders and four three
pounder.*, all revolving cannon and rapid
Are guns. Machine guns and electrii
search lights on a hollow steel military
mast wid complete tbe ship, which wil
take three and one-half years to build.
FLAX FOR WHEAT.
The Linen Plant the Better
Paying Product.
ADVICE TO AMERICAN FARMERS.
A Suggestion that Agriculturists
Pad Better Raise Yum Than
Breadstuff's.
Ansoi tared Prime Dispatches to the Hebaltj.l
Washington, May 12.—Last night,
Professor Wytlettl, the Assistant Secre
tary of Agriculture, had under considera
tion a letter from Ireland, which he
thinks may offer a solution of the
economy problem : ""What shall take the
place of wheat on farms where it can no
longer be raised at a profit?"" The
writer, who is familiar with flax-growing
and linen manufacturing Bince 1.H40, says
in bis interesting communication, that
there are only two weaving establish
ments, one at Webster, Mass., and the
other at Appleton, Wis.; the latter doing
but little, and neither weaving anything
finer than crash. There is nothing to
hinder the soil from producing just us
good flax and linen in every State in the
American Union, as in any country.
Germany now spins and weaves the
finest linen, and she has no essentially
different climate from America. Many
things have become successful in Amer
ica 'rom the facility with which the
people take up and adopt im
proved processes and appliances,
and this may be the salvation of the linen
industry, of tie importance of which
there is no question. There is every rea
son why American farmers should pro
duce a million acres of flax, both seed
and fibre, over and above what is now
produced, which would give 12,000,000 to
15,000,000 bushels of seed, worth as
many million dollars, and 2,500,000 tons
of flax straw, worth $50,000,000, and
from which 500,000 tons of flax fibre
would be obtained, worth $55,000,000.
Once established, American invention
would be called into operation in all
other industries to consume this raw ma
terial.
Professor Wytletts has informed the
sender that the subject of his letter
wculd be earnestly considered by Con
gress, which would lend its aid to any
effort to or diversify the agricul
tural industries of the country.
Tne Inspection Completed.
Chicago, May 12. —Secretary of War
Proctor, General Sohofield and others,

Jail Literature.
A number of good people have agreed
to give some reading matter to the jail
authorities, to form a sort of a free cir
culating library among the prisoners. A
set of book shelves has been provided by
the county and is now waiting for the
books. The boys are very curious to see
what kind of a selection of volumes the
church people will make ior them. Ono
of the vags in the lower tank expressed
the hops that there would ba a good life
of Johu L. Sullivan. It was suggested
by the reporter that probably the litera
ture provided would be of a very differ
ent characlor. ""Paley's Evidences,"" he
remarked, ""would be somewhat nearer
'he mark.""
""No,"" said the Vaf, ""we don't want
nothingonevidep.ee. The lavyerslook
out for all that.""
"" 'Butler's Analogy,' perhaps,"" con
tinned the reporter.
""What do the blokes want to send us
medical books for?"" said the hobo wag-
ging his head.
The chauces are that the occupants of
the iron rooms will be very much dis
gusted at the taste displayed by the com
mittee who will select the books.
Lively Competition Predicted.
The Redondo people are making tre
mendous efforts to start work on their
overland road, the details of which were
given in the Herald last week. It is
claimed for them that when they get into
operation they will make a revolution in
overland freight charges. It ha 3 been
often illustrated that freight can be
hauled to or from any metropolis for two
cents a ton a mile, but these figures are
increased about 500 per cant, by the
companies running into this city.
The Southern Pacific always
kc?ps tho exact amount of its earnings a
secret from the public, but it is known
to the Herald tbat during the year 1887
the line between San l'edro aud this city
earned $1,082,000, and the succeeding
years have doubtless been in propor
tion. When the Redondo road get into
operation, it is said that those at tbe
back of it will make an utter reform, and
will run at such figures that will entail
either a reduction by the Southern Paci
fic and the Santa Fe, or a complete com
petitive shut-out.
At Work Again.
Mr. A. L. Woolsey, train- dispatcher
for the Southern Pacific, has returned to
town, accompanied by his bride, and has
started in again on tha performance of
his duties. Mr. Woolsey is one of the
most efficient and reliable of tho South
irn Pacific's telegraphic staff, and the
officials are glad to see him back again.
He and his charming bride will at once
settle down to tho routine of housekeep
ing, having satisfied themselves with ex
cursions during their tour through tbe
northern part of the State.
Ready by September.
Mr. Dan Mc'Cool's special car, whic:
was badly wrecked in tlie accident last
month on tlie Chicago branch of the
Santa Fe, is being repaired, and the news
has been received that it will be ready
fnr the road again by next September.
Mr. McCool is highly gratified p.t this, as
the car cost him $8,000, and is said, by
Mr. J. P. Meehan, Pacific Coast Agent
for the Pullman Company, to he one of
the finest running coaches in the coun
try. It was originally built for Henry
Villard, of the Northern Pacific.

AFLOAT.
Written for The Mobnixo Calx.
Overhead the blue sky bends
here counties* planets shine;
Beneath the boat they seem to Moat,
And with the oars keep time.
A soft haze blends the mountain peaks
Ina long line of blue;
The dim shores change the outlines strange
And then recede from view.
I float apast an unknown laud,
Unreal as a dream.
Where treetons hign pierce the dim sty.
And pale lights lade and gleam.
To an unknown land my fancies drift.
And lulled by the ripi>lln< waves
They dreamily float from earth remote
Where perfumed waters lave.
The jeweled strand of islands rare,
There tropic flowers blow.
And 'mid the trees the whispering breeze
Sings to the waters low.
A faint and wondrous song they sing
In that blissful, shadowy land.
But half asleep, their music sweet
I scarce can understand.
Of lives as pure as lilies are,
Their murmuring echoes tell;
•With lofty deeds, and holy creeds
The numbers rise and swell.
AS past those fancy-!!.! isles
I float 'twixt sea and sUy,
The care-> of day all melt away,
And grief and sorrow fly.
With dim skies tending overhead
Where planets pale and glow.
And far beneath their gleams repeat
Id waving lines below.
'Tls Joy to drift between the shores
Of earth and fancies' isle.
While laud ami se.i lv harmony
The dreaming soul beguile.

THE LITTLE NUGGET.
It was given to Eflie to take care of. It
was not a great prize, for it weighed only
seven ounces, but it represented the only
result of a strong man's toil for many weeks,
and, as nuggets go, it was considered by no
means a bad ""find.""
John Archer decided that the nugget
would be safer in his little daughter's keep
ing tlian in his own. There were thieves
and lawless men at this new gold rush, as
at all new gold rushes, and they would
know of his prize. They would probably
try to annex it. They would search all sorts
of cunning hiding places in the neighbor
hood of his tent ; they might even creep into
the hut at n gut to feel under his pillow and
among his rough bedding for the yellow
earth that folk hate each other for. If he
caught the thief he would shoot him, but
better not to run the risk of losing his treas
ure. And so he gave it to Ertie to put In her
old work-box. The thieves of the T dig
dings would be too cunning to think of ex
amining such an improbable hiding place.
You must take great care of it, darling,""
•aid John Art her. ""It is for your mother.""
And Effie stowed the little nugget away in a
corner of the old work-box — which had been
her mother's — under the cotton and the
socks she was darning for her father. She
felt duly weighted with the responsibility.
She ki.ew that this yellow earth was of great
value, for her father, leaving her mother,
who was very sick, with some friends in
Brisbane, had come a long, weary way to
find it, and she had seen his sorrow, his
despair, as day after day he had eagerly
worked with pick and spade, without find
ing what he nought.
Having hidden the little nugget away Effie
came out of the nut to look around and see
if any one was near who might have seen
her. No. No one was near who might have
seen her— only B lly, the black— King Billy,
the aboriginal monarch, who loved tobacco,
and who was chopping some firewood for
her. King Billy evidently had not seen,
for he was wielding the ax with quite excep
tional vigor; and if Billy bad seen it would
not have mattered very much, for Effiie
trusted him.
This little girl's reason for trusting King
Billy, the black, was somewhat strange,
and is worthy of being recorded. She trust
ed him because she had been kind to bun.
But Erh'e was only 12.
As the child stood in the broad light, her
tumbled, hay-hard hair kissed aud il
lumined by the bold rays of the sun, and
her round, trustful blue eyes shaded from
the glare by two little bruwn hands, watch
ing King Billy at bis work, a flock of
laughing j?icka>ses alighted in a neighoor
ing gumtree and set up a demoniac
tion. What ina«!e the ill-omened birds so
madly merry? What was the Joke — Effie's
trust? Billy's gratitude? They failed to
explain; but their amusement was huge and
sardouic.
""Drive them away, Billy,"" cried Effie;
and .he obedient king dropped his ax and
threw a faegot of wuod at the tree, which
stopped the laughter and dispersed the
meirv-makers.
""Biliy tired now,"" said the blaclr, Rrin
niiig. r> leu much work— plenty wood,"" aud
he pointed to the result of his labor.
""Yes, t.'iat will be enough, thank you.
c a g iod boy. I'll give you soiue tj
bacco.""
""Billy's thirsty.""
""'lnet! you shall liave some t->a.""
.1. Bum.""
""No, Billy. Hum Isn't good for you.""
""Good for miners; good for Billy.""
""No, it's not p>od for miners,"" said Effie,
emphatic-ally; ""it makes them light and say
wicked things.""
""Makes black feller feel good,"" declared
Billy, rolling his dusky eyes.
This last argument was effective. Efne
went into her hut — her father had returned
to his work— and poured out a little rite
from John Archer's flask into a ""pannikin.""
Billy drank the spirits with roiling eyes,
smacked bid lips, and then lay down in the
shadow of the hut to sleep.
The lung afternoon passed very slowly for
Kffie. Her few trifling duties as house
keeper were soon done. The little hut was
tidied, and the simple evening meal pre
pared; and some hours must pass before
her father returned. llow could she pass
the time? She had only two books—
bible and a volume of stories for little girls,
which she had won as a prize at school in
Brisbane. Bui she was too young to appre
ciate the first, especially as the type being
wry small it was difficult reading, and she
had grown beyond appreciating the stories
for little girls, baying known them by
heart three years before. She would like to
have sl^pt. Everything around her sug
gested and invited the siesta— the steady
heat; the brightness of the light without
the hut; the distant murmur of miners'
voices, which came from beyond yonder
belt wattle gums; the monotonous bum
of the locusts in the forest; the occasional
fretful cry of a strange bird, and the regular
snores of the fallen kintr, who slumbered In
the shade of the hut. Even the buzz of the
annoying flies assisted the general effect and
brought drowsiness.
To remain still fur a few minutes would
have meant invariably falling asleep. Effle
felt this and remembered the little gold
uuggett. If she slept some thief might
come aud take it. And so she put on her
bat, and forsaking the seductive cool shade
of the hut, went out into the brightness and
heat
Archer's hut stood on the edge of the
valley, over against the foot of the blue,
heavily timbered hills. About, fifty yards
distant from it, hidden among the trees,
was a high moss-grown rock at the base of
which Effie had discovered the smallest and
sweetest of natural springs. Thither the
child ran— looking back often to see that no
one approached the hut in her absence— to
bathe her face. In a few minutes she re
turned, drying her face in her apron and
shaking her wet hair in the sun. No one
had come, but King Billy was now awake,
and was slouching lazily off toward the
bush. Eftie laughed as she saw him— his
great head bent forward, and his thin nar
row shoulders bowed. She laughed to think
of his laziness, aud that he should look so
tired after such a very little wood-chopping.
Sh« was still laughing at King Billy as sue
opened the old work-box 10 take another
peei> at the yellow treasure, nnd to make
quite sure that the heat hadn't melted away.
And it was quite slowly that the laugh died
from the pretty eyes and mouth— quite
slowly, because of the moments it took to
realize and accept a misfortune so terrible—
when she lifted the coarse socks and looked
and saw do little gold nugget— saw nothing.
Then horror and great fear grew in the blue
eyes, and pale agony crept over the childish
face and made it old, and the poor little
heart seemed to stop beating.
Etlie said nothing and made no cry; but
she closed her eyes tightly for a moment and
looked in the box again. No, it was no illu
sion; the little nugget was not there— the
first gold her father had found, which had
been intrusted to her care, which was to have
been taken to her mother— it was gone. She
piit down the box, quite quietly, and walked
out into the day; but the sun was shining
very strangely and mistily now, and tho
blue eky tiad grown black; and the trees
seemed to move weirdly ; and the locusts had
ceased humming from fear ; but the strange
bird was somewhere near, shrieking
brokenly, What will father say? What
will father say?""
But as the child stood there, despairing,
her sight grew clearer, and she saw a
black figure among the trees, and &be was
conscious of a pair of dusky eyes watching
her through the leaves. Then only she re
membered, and she knew who had done
this cruel tiling. King Billy 1 And she had
been kind to him. Erne suddenly burst into
passionate sobbing. The black figure still
hovered among the trees, often changing
its position, and the dusky eyes still peered

through the leaves. And the laughing jack
asses flew down to the old tree again, and
lauded more madly than before— laughed
at Effie's trust— at Billy's gratitude.
• ■•-■•.''.' • • • *
It was 10 o'clock, and darkness and quiet
reigned in John Archer's hut. Over among
the tents behind the wattle gums a few
gamblers and heavy drinkers were still
awake, and their voices, raised in anger or
ribald merriment, might occasionally have
been faintly heard from the hut. But
Archer, who had sown his wild oats, was a
true worker; and no had his little daughter,
for whose sake lie had built the hut away
from the noisy camp.
Archer had come home late and weary, as
usual, had eaten ha supper and gone to rest
without, to Effle's intense relief, speaking of
the little gold nugget. The child was afraid
to speak of the loss, and she was not with
out vague hopes that a beneficent provi
dence would restore the nugget during the
darkness aud save her frooi this great
trouble.
For this she prayed very earnestly before
sV lay down to sleep. Or di-1 she sleep at
all that night? She never quite knew. But
she thinks it was then that she fir-it experi
enced that terrible, purgatorial condition
which is neither wakelulness nor sleep,
when the body and mind are weary enough
to bring the profund sleep which they re
quire, but which the brain is too overladen
and too cruelly active to allow; when dreams
seem realities and Realities dreams. It must
have been a dream when she saw something
small and yellow float through the tiny win
dow on the ghostly silver inooubeams. And
yet, when, having closed her e.\es, she
opened them asain, it was still thore hover
ing about in the darkness— less bright now,
and with a Dale yellow halo. But it faded
quite away; it was a cruel, mocking dream.
Then was It a dream when the old curtain
which divided her coiner of the hut from
her father's moved near the ground— bulged
slightly toward her? It would be curious
to see, and she lay still. From under the
curtain seemed to come a thin arm, and
slowly, cautiously, after the arm a bead
with a great shock of hair. And the moon
beams just touched a face— l think they
kissed it, though it was black, for they
found iv a black hand the little yellow ob
ject which haa floated in the first dream.
It was ail so real, so beautiful, that the
child lay still, scarce daring to breathe, lest
the vision should melt away; aud when iv
her dream came the voice of her father.with
the words, "".speak, or I'll fire,"" her lips re
fused to open.
But it was no dream when the shot came
and the Black King rolled over un the
earth, dead, with tne little gold nuzget he
had come to restore Dressed in the death
agony against his heart, where, too, was a
little gold.
Aud the laughing birds in the old tree,
startled from their sleep by the shot,
laughed once more, wildly and madly, at
Billy's honesty; bat there was bitterness in
their merriment, [or their master, the devil,
had been cheated of the soul of a Black
King.— Ex.
GERMAN WAR-SHIPS.
Not Expected Until Next Week.
Coming Uuder Sail.
Cuiislderable reticence wns displayed yes
tt-rdHy at the German Consulate In this city
regarding the arrival of Admiral Valuis
and his squadron, uiid every iota of news,
no matter how remotely connected with the
naval visit, was guard""d with an assumed
jealousy as a state secret. There is liitle
reaa n for hiding what the whole German
population is discussing, and the idea pre
vails that the air of mystery is assumed to
couceal the fact that the imperial repre
sentatives here have either lost their heads
with excitement over the rarecccurrei.ee or
are really dependent upon the press for the
information they are buppi Bed iv have.
The C< nsulate officials denied the receipt
of any ndviees by the Peking, which ar
rived in the harbor at an curly hour yester
day, but admitted what was nut known the
day before, that the squadron nerd not be
looked for until the 3d or 4th of June, ex-
Hctly a mouth from their departure from
Yokohama. As a reasou for the leutfth of
I age they dye it as their opinion that
tlie Bbips are proceeding uud'-r sail, but the
reason for the supposition or the ptobabil-
Uy of their touching at Honolulu or Vic
toria could n it be ascertained.
Mr?. Admiral Valols, Mrs. Captain yon
Prantzius and several of the officers' la<ii*s
arrived yesterday ou the City of Peking
and were conveyed to the Palace Hotel,
which, it is said, they will leave to-day for
a visit to the interior, where they will re
main until tiie, iieet c(jii;es in. It was ru
mor< d that the ladies were accompanied by
one ol the squadron's officers, but this was
denied at tlie Consulate.
The members of the San Francisco
Veivin met Monday evening to consider
what steps they si.ould take with a view to

CONDITION OF TRADE.
Business Continues Quiet With
out Being Positively Dull.
Very High Prices for Cereals and Feedßtuffa.
Honey in Ample Supply and Collec
tions Up to the Average.
Trade continues quiet, nnd there is no ex
citement in any branch of business. The
ex ort movement of the. port is good, how
ever, and almost all articles of produce and
merchandiseare britiuiug fair prices. Money
is in ample supply for all current needs, and
the. demand for it is fair. Collections are
up to the average, and no serious failures
have been announced for some time. The
prospects for large crops are flattering, ami
a general feeling of confidence pervades the
mercantile community. The local bank
clearings last week were t18.313.504, agaiu3t
$14,247,272 for the same week last year..
THE <IKAI.N MAIIKET.
Wheat rules dull but ,-ite.idy. Most of it,
as already nieutione 1, is held by the exuort
ers, and some of the mills being unable to
obtain any have closed tfowa for a time.
Tlie first of the new crop arrived at Port
Costa Monday. It was a car-load of small
■lightly pinched Sonora, somewhat mixed
with barley, from the Knnberlena Farm of
Town & Kimberlin, Kern County. It was
auctioned oll.it 53 02)4 Der cental on the
Produce Exchange. Tho tir-it new wheat
last year arrived May 90th, and was inferior
to this year's Initial shipment, and sold at
8i 3a
Wheat freights are dull but steady, a3 far
as spot business Is concerned, at 42s b'd for
iron vessels, United Kingdom, Havre or
Antwerp.
Flour is dull but steady, and closing down
of some of the mills his a tendeuey to
stieiij{tti»'n the already high prices. An
other effect is seen in a radical advance in
bran and middlings which are very expen
sive articles to buy just now, being scarce.
Barley is t iff and wiiile choice feed com*
m nds the remarkable figure ot $1 55 option
sales at SI 00 were made yesterday. 'Ihese
his, r !i prices at the very tail end of the season
are largely due to the lines of ""shorts,""
which must he tilled, hence the advance in
quotations. But speculation aside barley
has been dear for months.
Oats rule steady at the high prices. Offer
ings are moderate and the demand Is fair.
Corn continues to ascend skyward ai^d is
now high enough to suit almost anybody.
Yellows range from §1 60 to Si 65 and
choice white has sold up to §2 10. These
are the highest prices for years. Corn is
not dear because it is scarce, but because
stinks are in the mam controlled by one
local house and orders for 16,000 centals for
Central America have just been filled.
OKMKBAL COLXTKY PBODUI K.
While good hay i> lit m at high price?, the
farmers are unwittingly breaking the mar
led fur the new crop by sending in half
cured new hay in their eagerness to secure
returns before the market declines. 1 his
imperfect hay conios in damp, hot aud
I wealing and wnrks injury to good, well
cured hay, as it has to be sold at compara
tively luw puces. Dealers, however, say
that as soon as this trashy hay is got out of
the way, and the properly cured hay corner
in, the market will probably be steadier at
pood prices, bo, the obviously right way
to secure satisfactory returns is to cure the
hay as it should be cured before sending it
to market.
Hops continue dull. As remarked last
weeK, tie continual reports of lice in En
gland and some parts of this country tend
to make both buyers and growers cautious
about entering into contracts for -the new
crop, and dealers do not look for much
business until the question of lice is pretty
definitely settled. Thus far no serious
damage is reported.
Wool is in fair demand at unchanged
prices.
Hides aro dull and quotations have not
changed for some time.
Potatoes and onions sell at about last
week's prices. Both are In ample supply
for all current necessities.
Butter and eg;zs have both advanced and
are lirui at the rise. "" Choice eggs ar« getting
scarce. Butter comes in freely but packing
it keeps dowu the surplus. Cheese is
weaker.
Dried fruits, nuts and raisins are dull,
and not materially changed. Raisins arc
particularly neglected.
Growers of fresh fruit are asking 2c per
pound or S4l) per ton for peaches, apricots
and linrtlett pears nt orchard or station.
The canners are making a tight against pay.
iug this price, and are bidding $25 to §30.
Most of the few sales thus far reported are
$30 to $40 per ton. Trices for prunes aro
Dot yet settled.
The meat market is well supplied and
prices show no change.
GROCEHIES AND PKOYIBIONS.
Sugar lias shown no change since the
Western Sum Refining Company issued its
first price list a fortnight aao. In this con
nection it is interesting to note that consid
erable quantities of sugar are reported in
transit tioin Germany to San Francisco.
English granulated sugar, it is reported, is
being offered In New York at 4 Beats Hud
Scotch yellow refined sugars continue to
arrive at that port by Oiassow steamers,
with more known to be afloat, sales of
which are making at :; ; 4 to 3% cents.

erally. the maikei ha* undergone 110 practical
change since Him Issue of our circular of May
Ist. Although jobber* complain of ■ slow coun
try demand, the sale» from lust hands so far
(lining May luve agzreg:at<Ml nearly equal the
usual monthly pro rain, but trade lia« been of
such a hand to-moutli diameter that the gradual
absolution has not been noticeable and (lie mar
ket tin seemincly ruled very dull. Witu scarcely
an exception, second hands arc working on Unlit,
stocks, and any Improvement In the dl»tilbutfve
movement would be Immediately tell by import
ers. Local business has been mainly counued to
the qualities ranging from fair downward, pi ice,
not quality, being apparently the Bret considera
tion with buyers. (iuod unwashed Salvador lias
moved slowly, closing dull at I&V4 cent?, With
but little-inquiry. Co-la Rica continues more or
less neglect d ;ind diflicult of sale ut tlie quota
tions given, but the transactions made show no
Change in values. Uood to prime washed Guate
mala is In demand [or shipment overland at full
prices, about 1800 bags being taken during the
pun three wee* a. Late arrivals have contained
but a small percentage of these qualities, pre
venting a much larger business with Eastern
points than has been dove.
Canned lobster has been advanced. Can
ned green peas, new pack, are moving off
freely at $1 05 to 81 15 per dozen, Canned
fruit is quiet and spot price* are weak,
owing to the approach of the new season,
while opening prices for tlie new pack are
firm at about last year's opeuiu-g prices,
apricots excupted, these being higher.
Eastern buyers, on the other hand, are
holding off. maintaining that California
canners are asking too high figures. Ad
vices from Baliimore are to the effect that
packers there are Baking strenuous efforts
to secure business, and are naming low
figures for next tack. Canned salmon is
firmly held at last week's prices, with some
Eastern and foreign inquiry.
Rice shows no variation worthy of note.
GENERAL M 1 . 1 : (M A XI » 1 .
Cigars and tobacco are fairly active.
The demand for dry goods is nothing
extra. In lact, business is behind that of
last year.
The cause of the reduction of Si In lum
ber by the Pacific Pine Lumber Company,
which went into effect on the 18 h inst., is
said 10 be over production, brought about
by the building of new mills when trade
1 was stimulated uy the Southern boom, aud
later by a similar excitement on the Sound.
In both sections the demand has decreased
mid the foreign inquiry has slacked, so that
while a steady business is done in this mar
ket and in the interior, it is inadequate to
handle the large cut of the coast alter the
light wants loreign and in the late active
sections are supplied.
No further decline in coal is announced,
but the market is weak and heavily sup
plied. Tho week's recMMpU were 12,727 tons
cc;i>t and 3250 tons from Japan. The mar
ket is getting bare of ligaiuit, owing to
labor dittii'iiliies at the northern Collieries,
but steam and bituminous house coals are
in liberal supply and easy, with supplies
obtainable at concessions from the public
quotations.

TKIXITY SCHOOL.
A Closely Contested Struggle for the
Spelling Prize.
The first part of the closing exercises of
Trinity school were brought to a highly suc
cessful conclusion yesteiday afternoon,
when a number of the friends of the boys
assembled to witness the semi-annual spell
ing match. Previous to the school assem
bling, the visitors occupied themselves with
inspecting the neatly finished maps and
specimens of penmanship and geometrical
drawing which were arranged alone the
walls. These were the work of the boys
during the term, and the drawings, some of
which were advanced work, were especially
admirable.
The whole school, with the exception of
the preparatory classes, took part in the
spelling match, the conditions of which were
that a single failure meant irretrievable dis
aster and barred the unlucky boy from fur
ther coin petition. A few, a very few, failed
at the first round, but the majority proved
adepts in wrestling with the vagaries of
English orthography. Slowly, however, the
destructive polysyllables thinned the ranks,
until at the conclusion of the tenth round
thirteen boys alone survived.
The successful ones who will bo credited
with full marks In the spelling examination
were Ivati M. Linfortu, Emory Cole, Guy
Post, Cnlrt auntier.s, Lorenzo Carruthers,
Percy O'Brien, Percy King, Erie Brownell,
John Thompson, Hale li x, Harry Chester,
Gerald Lyons and James Hind.
The match, however, still went on to de
termine the winner of tlie semi-annual
spelling prize. Ivan Linforth, who enlisted
the sympathy of tne spectators from his be
ing the smallest participant, and the cool
self-possession with which he ta ki-d ses
quipedalian words, looked to have a good
chance until he tripped «»ver the, number of
I's in palatial. One by one the other contest
ants drop | ed out until the contest narrowed
down to Erie Brownell and James Hind. A
few more words left Hind the winner of the
hardest foughtspelling match In the history
of the school, as Dr. Spalding said after
ward.
At the conclusion of the spelling match
the Rev. Dr. E. B. Spaldlng, rector ol the
school, announced taft order of the closing
exercises, which will take place to-d iy.
At 11 o'clock ther. 1 will be a rhetorical
competition for the gold medal which is an
nually presented by the Alumni of the
school. The sucee>slul candidate will be
rhosen by a committee of the graduates.
The graduating exercises will be held at 8
o'clock in the evening and will consist of es
saysread by the graduating class and the
award of medal-, prizes and diplomas. Or.
Nieholla, the assistant bishop of the diocese,
will be present and deliver an address.

Fire Insurance company of New York,
and is one of the syndicate of ten,
headed by Henry Morgenthau, that
purchased the Morton-Bliss property at
New York for a million dollars, which
is the biggest real estate deal on record.
The syndicate cut the property up into
lots and sold it out inside of six weeks
for a trifle less than a million and a half
dollars.
Mr. Armstrong on being interviewed
said:
I myself being one of the largest
growers of fruit and nuts on the coast,
having over 100,000 acres under cultiva
tion, comprising some 70,000 trees, am
naturally interested in any plan which
could look forward to a practical system
of economy in the cost of production,
shipping marketing and collecting the
proceeds of these California products.
""A fruit trust"" such as announced by
the Associated Press dispatches from
New York, however, is the most remote
thing from my mind. While one, two
or a half-dozen men can agree on a def
inite line of policy, still they may not
be able to arrange plans and details
which would meet with the universal
approval of so large and important an
industry as the fruit interest of Califor
nia. It might look like assumption on
nay part to even - suggest in the face of
ability already shown by these Califor
nia fruit growers, a plan whereby each
and every one of them may be advanced,
but in view of the fact that the fruit
growers themselves in conventions
assembled freely discuss their weakness
on certain points, I feel certain that
the plan I have to offer, with slight mod
ifications will meet with almost uni
versal approval.
The plan is substantially as folfows:
One large corporation to own so much of
the fruit-growing interests as can be
profitably admitted to the company,
both large and small growers being eli
gible, provided, however, that enough
small growers in a given locality come
into tbe corporation to make the care,
culture and handling of their products
profitable to tbe corporation, in which
all would be interested to the extent of
the agreed value of their properties.
Without a thorough investigation of
the matter it would be impossible to de
termine upon the amount of tbe capital
stock of the corporation, but I should
think it could be conservatively esti
mated at $50,000,000. Let it be, fees or
more, it would be divided into shares of
$100 each, and each party interested
would be entitled to subscribe in the
same proportion that the agreed value
of his property bears to the aggregate.
It is proposed to issue a general first
mortgage bond bearing not to exceed,
say, 8 per cent interest, of what is
known as a ten-thirty bond, that is,
redeemable at the pleasure of the corpo
ration after ten years and payable in
thirty years, these bonds to be issued
for an amount equal to, say, per
cent of the capital. This would place
in the hands of the fruit growers of
California between $15,000,000 and $20,
--000,000 in cash with which to further
develop the resources of this great state.
My mission here is to pledge the neces
sary amount of money to carry out the
objects contemplated.
The corporation is to be managed by
a board of trustees of the recognized
leaders, or rather the most successful
fruit growers of California. The
manifold benefits to be derived
from such a board of trustees
would be the combined experi
ence of these men: first, in plant
ing; second, in cultivating; third, in
pruning; fourth, in packing; fifth, dry
ing; sixth seventh, shipping;
eighth, rates of transportation such as a
large corporation could command;
ninth, in not glutting certain markets;
tenth, in being able to reach all markets
of the world; eleventh, the prompt and
economic collection of eastern ex
changes, even though it be necessary to
establish a banking institution that
would appreciate the necessities of thia
great industry. Another advantage of
this corporation that will be recognized
by every grower of fruit on tbe coast, is,
that from one cause or another a certain
county or section' of the state suffers
in certain years from drought, rain,
insects, or other unforseen causes,
while the remainder of the state enjoys
great prosperity. This would be over
come entirely if each grower shared
equally in the prosperity of the fruit
growing of the whole state.
While I have pointed out in a general
way the benefits all interested growers
might hope derive from tbe combined
knowledge of these trustees, it is recog
nized fact that each of them have their
particular strong points in certain
branches, all of which united would
make a tower of strength.
It is proposed to'list both stock and
bonds on the New York stock exchange,
by reason of which any grower who
decided to retire from active business
could at once sell his holding with as
much celerity as other first-class se
curities.

, STATE BOARD OF TRADE.
Efforts Being Made to Market California
Frnlt A,broad.
San Francisco, Feb. 9. —At a meeting
of the state board of trade today Secre-
Maslin read several letters of an encour
aging nature, relative to the proposed
establishment in London of an exchange
for tbe marketing of California prod
ucts. It waa explained that L. C- Mc-
Afee, of Bakersfield, had taken general
charge of this proposed scheme for mar
keting fruit abroad, and was arranging
the details.
At the Auburn citrus fair over 4600
pounds of dried fruit were donated to
the state board to be distributed by
General Booth of the Salvation army
among tbe poor of the great metropolis.
More is being obtained from different
produce; 1 ? about tbe state, and will be
forwarded to England very soon.
Suggestions as to the meth
ods of advertising the possi
bilities of our farming, and of our
marketing our products, were given at
length. The experience of a Fresno
man, Mr. Chilgren, who lately went to
Minneapolis and sold his raisins, net
ting 5 cents a pound, or about $100 per
acre, was related and commented upon
favorably.
COAST DEFENSE GUNS.
A Gun Factory Badly Needed on the Pa
cific Coast.
Washington, Feb. 9. —General Flay
ler, chief of the bureau of ordnance, ap
peared before the coast defense commit
tee of the senate this morning, and
urged the establishment of a gun factory
on the Pacific coast. Regarding the
number of guns necessary for the pro
tection of the three principal points on
the Pacific, namely San Diego, San Fran
cisco and the north of the Columbia
river, General Flayler said it would re
quire 135 new steel guns and 160 steel
mortars.
Relative to the defenses of San Fran
cisco, the general said it was the present
plan to mount all tbe eight and ten
inch guns on disappearing carriages;
the larger guns to be placed in barbette
and metal turrets. These disappearing
carriages would cause the gun to disap
pear behind the parapet, which conceals
and protects the gun and its personnel
while loading and firing.
In response to a question as to the
carriages for guns already completed,
the general said none were now finished,
but three weeks ago (evidently having
in mind the Chilean affair) he was pre
pared to mount in haste, guns on old
carriages now on the Pacific coast.
WINTER IN IDAHO.
The Severest Season on Cattle Ever
Known In That State.
Boise City, Idaho, Feb. 9. —Another
heavy snow storm is prevailing through
out Southern Idaho, greatly to the dis
couragement of the stockmen, who had
honed for an early spring. The present
fall of snow will amount to six inches,
making it impossible for the starving
cattle and horses to uncover the
scant feed. Stock men say there
is absolutely no hope for
the stock on the ranges. Thousands of
animals are already dead, and the efforts
to save the remaining thousands will be
abandoned. In some of the valleys the
farmers have run short of feed and
have been compelled to turn the'poorest
of their stock adrift to starve. Scores
of complaints regarding starving ani
mals have been made to the stock in
spector, but he is powerless to act. The
present winter has never been equaled
in Idaho.
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
The State Can Not Pay A. J. Bourne for
the Logs of Hig Arm.
San Francisco, Feb. 9. —The supreme
court has declared unconstitutional the
law passed by the last legislature appro
priating for the relief of A. J.
Bourne, a guard at San Quentin, who
lost an arm while in the discharge of
his duty. The court says if the state
desires to make itself liable for such
damages as may be sustained by those
in its Bervice, it must do so by a general
law, which may embrace all caees which
may come within its provisions.
PLAYED HIGHWAYMEN.
Two Boyg Who Did Not Know the Plgtol
Wag Loaded.
San Francisco, Feb. 9.—Ernest Cook,
aged 13, and Joseph Riley, aged 16 years,
played they were highwaymen today.
Both were armed with pistols, and in
the progress of the game drew on each
other, Riley got tbe drop first and sent
a bullet into Cook's brain, inflicting a
fatal wound. Neither boy knew the
pistol was loaded.
San Francisco Highbinders.
San Francisco, Feb. 9. —It was at first
believed that the murder of Dr. Chuey
Sue Yee, the Chinese physician who
was shot Saturday night, was merely a
wanton murder, not due to highbinder
clans. Now, however, the police are
confident it was committed by order of
the Chin Ling Sam society. The head
quarters of this society were raided to
day, and the idols and paraphernalia
smashed. A new police station will be
opened tomorrow morning in the heart
of Chinatown. Seven officers have been
assigned to it, and it is belieyed the
highbinder wars will now be kept under
better control.
Sacramento City Politic!.
Sacramento, Feb. 9.—The local polit
ical situation is daily assuming new and
interesting features. Under the new
election law, independent candidates
feel assured of fair play at the polls,
hence there will be an unusual number
in the field. BesideSjtbe Republican,
Democratic and Citizens' nominees, va
rious individuals are_ getting up peti
tions in support of their own candidacy.
Today James Touhey and E. H. McKee
entered the list for second trustee, and
E. M. Stevens for chief of police.
The Salt Lake Electlong.
f*alt Lake City, Feb. 9.—The official
count of the city election shows an av
erage Liberal plurality of 1882, and an
average Liberal majority over all of
1104. The pluralities ranged from 1794
to 1938, and the majorities from 946 to
1273. The result here is held to be a
mighty protest against the passage of
the Faulkner or Teller bill. The Liberal
plurality in this city at the last prior
election (last August) was 1116; majori
ty at that election, 773.
That Stallion Race.
New York, Feb. 9.—The stallion Al
cryone and his owner, Frank I. Noble,
have been finally expelled by the Na
tional Trotting association. This de
cision waß reached by tbe board of re
view at its meeting today. The history
of tbe case is well known.
Housekeepers
""Wfill T?""ti/-1 great Care necessar y to prevent dan-
VV 111 V Hia rto the family food through the
introduction of the low grade baking powders that
contain lime and alum.
All baking powders that are offered, the public under
misrepresentation as to their ingredients are to be
avoided.
Baking powders now advertised as having published
upon their labels all the ingredients used in them are
shown by the Government investigation to have in their
composition four different substances not upon their label,
amounting to a large per cent, of their entire weight, two
of which substances are lime and sulphuric acid! Most
of the alum powders are sold by falsely representing
them as pure and wholesome cream of tartar powders.
Protection from alum baking powders
can be had only by declining to accept
any substitute for the Royal. All official
tests prove it to be a cream of tartar
baking powder superior to all others in
purity, strength and wholesomeness.
See that no baking powder is received
into your kitchen in place of the Royal,
FIREBUGS AT SAN DIEGO.
Several Dastardly Attempts at Starting
a Conflagration.
San Diego, Feb. 9. —Several fires have
occurred in this city during the past few
days, a few of which are known to have
been incendiary. The report was cir
culated that a slight blaze that occurred
in the St. James hotel was incendiary,
but there is no substantiation of the
fact. There was a fire about 1:30 this
morning in the Leland block, one of the
best buildings in the city,which is known
to have been started by some one with
evil design. Shortly after the alarm
was turned in, an empty gasoline can
and a bundle of rags, saturated with
oil and gasoline, were found at the door
of a lodger on the third floor of the
building. Just before the fire was dis
covered, a man was heard to run
through the hall and down stairs. The
occupants of the building, which is
used as an apartment house, were
thoroughly terrified as the house
was quickly filled with smoke. Several
women were caught on the point of
jumping from second and third story
windows. An hour later fire was die
covered in another part of town, in an
unoccupied building, but was extin
guished before much damage was done.
The citizens are thoroughly aroused, and
efforts will be made to have the police
force increased. The town is overrun
with tramps who come here to escape
the cold weather.
The Remains of Young Klein.
Placerville, Cal., Feb. 9.—The re
mains of young Klein, one of the two
young men who perished in the moun
tains in December last, were brought to
Placerville today by William Watson
and William Ryhard. The body, which
was found two miles this side of Straw
berry valley, was horribly mutilated by
wolves and coyotes. Both feet were
missing, and the flesh from the
limbs and face was entirely eaten
away. The remains, notwithstanding
their almost unrecognizable condition,
were positively identified by J. Klein
of Carson City, aa those of his son. The
reward of $200 for the recovery of the
body waa immediately paid over to Wat
son and Ryhard by the father, who will
take the remains to Oakland for burial.
Owing to the great depth of the snow in
the mountains, the finders were three
days in getting the remains to this city,
a distance of forty miles.
An Adjournment Resolution.
Washington, Feb. 9.—The first ad
journment resolution offered in the
house this session made its appearance
today. It was offeied by Busbnell of
Wisconsin, and provided for the final
adjournment of the first session Tues
day, May 31st. Referred to the com
mittee on rules.

SOCIETY AT CHRISTMAS
The Week Devoted to Home and
Preparations for the
Season.
BURLINGAME AND DEL MONTE.
House Parties at San Mateo— Staples
Christinas Tree— Announcement
of Events in View.
Christmas week, which opened on Mon
day, will be, as usual, devoted for the
most I art to home entertainments and i
gatherings and to preparations for the
holiday season generally, which closes on
January 2.
The last week, although for the most
part tray, felt also in anticipation tne near j
coming of the festival followed so closely i
by me Xew Year, and at all the gather- j
inps of the week the taik has been of trees
and gifts and holly branches and mistle
toe, and there was an all-pervading sense
of Christmas in the air.
The influence of these great festivals I
upon the society world becomes more and
more strongly marked each succeedine
year, and those who arrange for social
entertainments or who direct the move
ments of the social army have Ion;; since
learned that these festivals will not allow
of change and that their plans must bend
to them. By common consent Christmas
day and week has been left to the home
and children, and this year will prove no
exception to trie ruie.
In the meantime the elder members of
the smart set will hie to Del Monte and
Burlingame for the new year. This leav
ing town has been a enstom of tne East
for many years past and is now becoming
inure and"" more popular every year. At
Del.Monte will be found many familiar
faces. Bo far the weather seems settled,
but even should the elements be unfavor
able quite a number of attractions have
been provided, lluber's orchestra leaves
for there e3rly in the week. The bath
house is to be opened for the occasion, and
the usual New Year ball is lo be made
more attractive and enjoyable than ever.
A special train will be run, which will
make the trin a short and pleasant one.
At Burlingame there will be a dance,
races and sports, and as many as can be
accommodated at the clubhouse and the
cottages in the near neighborhood will
attend.
Although the Wallace ball, the first
meeting of the Monday Evening danc
ing class and the Assembly are over four
weeks in the past, the dancing proper
did not really begin in earnest un
til the week past closed. On Friday last the
fi:st of the series of cotillon.-., and ""one long
anticipated— namely, the first cotillon of ifte
Friday Night Club— came off at Odd Fellows'
Hall. The dance of this week will be the
< hristmas dance of the Friday Fortnightly
Cli:b on this Friday at Lunt Hall, where It is
to be hoped the proprietor will put op sbme
fresu Christmas creens and make the place
look more cheerful. The dance followed by
the cotillon will be a merry one, and it is seid
many of the members of the older set are to
be present, so the youths who think it is aanc-
Ing to back a eirl all around the room in a
most ridicuious way will be in the minority.
Why the.-c youths do not pay at least some
attention to guiding: is what has been troubling
their unfortuate partners, to say nothing of
the others for some time. The same may be
fcaid of a well known and popular army officer,
who is second to none as a dancer, but* has au
t'<jv.al reputation for bumping into people.
Quite n large number of family dinners were
jnven yesterday and several others were fol
lowed by a dauce, the most enjoyable, one
being that civen by Miss Rose Hooper at the
Occidental Hotel.
On Wednesday, the 18tn inst., the teachers
of the Le Count Primary School were most de
lightfully entertained at luncheon given them
by Miss ""Whit taker of cooking-schooi fame; the
dainty attendance of Beveral bonny maidens
from the class under her Instructions helped
materially in giving zest to the whole affair.
sail Mateo promises a gaj New Year week.
There will be quite a number of bouse i artk-s,
nnd on New Year's eve tlie Burlinßame Club
will entertain their friends with a dance.

EQBBEE-TKADE BOOM.
Many Modern Improvements and Much
Economy In the Manufacture.
One of the most interesting of current
events, from the view-point of the electri
cian, is the newly developed production of
rubber in Lagos. In 1830 no imports of
this article were recorded as received from
the colony, and last year the amount was ;
only $20,970. By a single steamer which i
left Lagos at the beginning of last month,
however, the value of the rubber shipped
to Liverpool was $75,000.
The new industry has ta&en hold of the
inhabitants of Lacos indiscriminately with
the rush of a gold craze. Numbers of
clerks, small traders and others even, it
is said, professional men— have packed
their traps and gone into the interior to
take their chance in collecting and manu
facturing tne gum.
The native owners of the forests have a
shrewd appreciation of the bearing of this
unwonted excitement and are insisting on
the payment of royalties. Some of them
are even entering into the business of pre
paring the rubber for market.
Prices in the interior have been consid
erably advanced and there is no longer as
much prolit as there was at first in pur
chasing and transporting the products of
tie coast.
The fear among electricians that an ar
tilicial rubber would have to be resorted to
in consequence of the increasing scarcity
of the natural product has, for the pres
ent, at all events, been allayed. In many
rubber sources the wholesale destruction
of trees by the natives has been stopped, j
and odd kinds of rubber are cropping up
from unexpected quarters. Several new
sorts, together with the familiar little
black balls with a white center, come from
the west coast of Africa.
A new product comes from Madagascar.
It has a horny appearance and contains
much earth. Nothing certain Is known
of its botanical oriein. From New Zealand
have been received packages of a rubber
whicn appears very elastic, but which does
not bear cutting up well. It is the product
of the banyan, and the rapidity and facil
ity with which the tree reproduces itself is
an important factor, in view of the waste
ful methods still adopted by the natives,
who practically destroy the tree to obtain
the rubber.
Improvements and economy in the man
ufacture of rubber have also been effected
by tlie nse of more efficient machinery,
and especially by the adoption of large
rollers. So far i: has not been possible to
eliminate the sulphur contained in vulcan
ized rubber, and all processes for the man
ufacture of old rubber are more or less
unsatisfactory.— Pi ttsburg Dispatch.
TEE BAGPIPE REVILED.
To Add to the Insult the Availing Pipes
""Were Termed a Wudelsaok.
A conflict over a matter which to sev
eral of the interested parties appearad to
be of mighty consequence, was narrowly
averted recently iv Justice of the Peace
Clarke's courtroom in Milwaukee. A
damage suit was in progress when one of
the attorneys alluded to a bagpipe as ""an
alleged musical instrument,"" and in a
moment the trouble was on, there being
several Scotchmen in court.
The suit on trial was that of William
Matthseua against the Wisconsin Theater
Company, the owner of Wonderland.
Mr. MattfiJEus sued for damages arising
from a runaway occasioned by the adver
tising wagon of the museum company.
He claimed that while tr.e wagon was pro
ceeding up the street drawing a Scotch
jiiper, wi.o was pipine merrily, his
(MatthEPits') horse became frightened.
The piper, Mr. Matthams asserted, was
aware that the animal was scared, but
nevertheless continned to pipe. The
frightened horse ran away.
When the complaint was read it was
found that the bagpipe was described as
""an alleged musical instrument."" To this
every one present of Scotch ex.raction im
mediately dissented with much heat and
for awhile the suit \v;:s forgotten in the ar
gument over the sli.-hting term. Authori
ties were cited to show what constitutes a
musical instrument, but to no purpose, the
attorney for the plaintiff insisting on using
the term in his address to the jury and the
Jus ico was obliged to overrule a motion
to restrain the attorney from its us \
But the trouble was far from settled, for
when the plaintiff, who is a German and
unable to talk English, gave his testimony
he alluded to the bagpipe as ""em dudel
sack."" Again every Scotchman was on
his feet and the argument resumed. Ex
citement ran high for some moments, but
the Justice, with the aid of the Constable,
was enabled to quiet the belligerents and
restore order. The jury, whi.:h was evi
dently not composed of Scotchmen, found
for the plaintiff, sriving him $1:25 damages
and costs. — Evening Wisconsin.
Mr. wml Mrs. Cleveland.
Mrs. Cleveland always refers to him as
""the President,"" both in his presence and
in his absence. A member of the Cabinet
says that he once heard her call him
""Grover"" when they were skylarking a
little on a fishing trip, but he thinks she
was only making fun. He does not know
that she has ever called him ""Grover""
since, although lie has been with them a
great deal. Sometimes she addresses him
as 'Mr. Cleveland,""' but when she speaks
of him in the third person she never uses
his name. It is always ""the President
says,"" or ""the President went to town,"" or
'""the President likes to live at Woodley
better than in tlie White House."" When
the children are present she invariably
addresses him as ""papa."" He calls her
""Frank' almost invariably, except on
occasions of formality or in the presence
of strangers. When he speaks of her in
her absence to the members of the Cabinet
and other friends, he usually says ""my
wife.""— Chicago Ilecord.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER * 26, 1895.
LEFT A TRAIL OF BLOOD.
A Burglar Leaves Sanguinary
Evidence of Doing Thor
ough Work.
WANTED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
He Ransacked the Residence of Henry
Goodall, but Left Some of
His Spoils.
When Henry Goodall, the propertyman
at the Baldwin, and his family returned
to their home at 1417 Oak street after the
theater on Monday night they found the
gas lighted in every room. As they had left
the house dark they entered hastily, to
Jearn that the house had been ransacked
by burglars, who had left a broad trail of
blood from one end of the residence to the
other.
The men, for there were two of the bur
glars, evidently knew that there was no
one at home in the Goodall house or in the
fiat just above, occupied by H. R. Ackart,
the bookmaker, for they had done some
very rough work in trying to pry open a
rear window. Failing in this one had
broken the upper part of the lower pane
of glass, and inserting his hand had turned
the hasp.
In doing this he cut either his hand or
his wrist very severely. They were in too
much of a hurry to bind it up, though,
and at once entered the house and set to
work.
From the kitchen they went to every
1 room in the house, evidently hunting for
money. They turned down the bed-cov
ers and felt in the pillows, all the time
leaving great splashes of blood on every
thing. The bureaus and sideboard were
ransacked, and Mr. Goodnll's secretary wan
broken open and the papers in it were
tossed about and stained with blood.
In this secretary they found some silver
heirlooms. They took these, as well as
all the table silver and two watches be
longing to Mrs. Goodkli's sons. There was
only a little money found.
The thieves had then laid out two new
suits of clothes, several other pieces and
an alarm clock, and had just brought a
valise to the rooni to put them in when
Mr. Ackert's Chinese servant returned.
The noise made by the Mongolian sounded
as if it were at the Goodalls' front door,
owing to the formation of the nouse, and
the thieves escaped.
This was the story told by the stream of
blood and the footprints. Word was sent
at once to the police ar.d a sergeant and
two men examined the premises. They
measured the footprints and are on a hot
search for the burglars.
There have been no robberies in the
Panhandle district of late. A number of
suspicious characters have been hanging
around though, and the police have strong
suspicions as to whom the guilty parties
are.
A number of extra watchmen have been
fmt on by interested parties since the burg
ary. Several new buildings are going up
and the watchman of these has been reen
forced with an assistant.
Although there were many valuable
articles of vertu and costly ornaments in
the Ackert fiat, no attempt was made to
enter it. The burglars devoted themselves
to the lower flat.
CHRISTMAS IT HOME
f Continued from SttU/t I'ape.]
sineing and mnsic were under the direc
tion of Mr. Holt.
Bishop Nichols took his text from the
sixth verse of the fourth chapter of the
Second Epiptle to the Corinthians: ""The
knowledge of the power of God is in the
face of Jesus Christ.""
His theme was that it was useless to
start anew to discuss the divinity and per
sonality of Christ, as the questions early
raised were settled conclusively long ago
by tne best intellects of several centuries.
'.During his extemporaneous discourse he
said :
Knowledge implies *tudy. Study is not
merely makir.c use of what is around us, but a
searching observation of ir.
Whj e ■■> !'»<'k to the past? Why not have the
d<-pnrtinent of a university search out the facts
while ""c wait for the pronunciamento? Be
cause, dear friends, it is a subject that occu
pied ihe intellect of centuries, nnd a fair mind
will say that the anility and intellect expended
upon the discussions during centuries gone by
are not exceeded by this nineteenth century. ""
A perron asks why do yon believe he was a
Bavior? If you wish the ultimate, scientific
lorniula that has stood the test of nineteen
centuries you have it in that we recited this
morning In the Nicene creed. In the litany it
is expressed: ""Hy the mystery of the holy in
carnation, good i.ord deliver u-i."" In the Te
Deuni it is, ""Thou art the king of glory, O
Christ.""
At the close of the Bishop's sermon
Frank Coffin sang Adam's ""Noel."" Com
munion service was held after the regular
service.
CHURCH OF THE ADVENT.
Appropriate Mnsic and Services at Rector
Emory's Church on Eleventh Street.
There was the typical Christmas service
at thi? Church of the Advent (Episcopal)
on Eleventh street, near Market, yester
day — such a celebration of the anniversary
of the Savior's birth as the English church
men enjoy.
The church is peculiarly adapted for
celebrations of religious festivals, for its
interior, with its semi-Gothic outlines,
recalls, spiritually, the Yule-tide worship
of York and Canteroury.
The first thintr noticed on entering was
the effect of the illuminations and decora
tions. Surroundin<,' the liis;h screen which
incloses the sanctuary was a five-pointed
star ablaze with ignited gas. Beneath this
reminder of the ""Star of Bethlehem"" was
a cross of ferns and evergreens, and the
entire screen was decorated with the rich
green of the forest and numerous laurel
wreaths. The altar was literally covered
with callas and white chrysanthe
mums. All the candelabra were aflame
and the pews of the auditorium were set
off with bunches of fern, evergreen and
acacia. The rulpit was enveloped in
ferns.
Rector John A. Emory's sermon was
from Hapgai ii:7, ""And I will shake all
nations and the desire of ail nations shall
come, and I will till this house with glory,
saith the Lord of hosts."" The scriptural
selection was made to serve as a basis for
an elaboration of the effect of Christ's ad
vent upon human civilization.
The musical programme was very select.
Professor H. Blosson Jr. was at the organ
and the following programme was given,
the choir consisting of sixty men and boys:
Processional, Venite, Gloria Patri, Te Denm,
Jubilate, Introit, Kyrie, Gloria Tibi, Credo,
hymn, offertorium. presentation, Sursum
Cbrda, Sauctus, Benedictus, hymn, Agnus Dei,
Gloria in Excelsis, Kane Diinittis and Ketro
ccssional.
To-day jjie children's festival will take
place and ""The Land of Nod,"" an operetta,
will be presented. Next Sunday the prizes
wiil be distributed to the children.
AT ST. PETER'S CHUBCH.
Impressive Services Held in Commoration of
the Day.
The largest congregation that has at
tended service in St. Peter's Episcopal
Church on Stockton street, near Filbert,
was present yesterday morning, Rev.
Mardon D. Wilson officiated, and delivered
a brief sermon, taking for his text the
angelic song. ""Glory to God in the high
est.""
Mr. Wilson said that into the very pres
ence of God th? glorious songof the angels
was sung and echoed back upon the earth
Id that far-off night in Bethlehem. In the
highest strums of which men were capa
ble the church of God here militant on
earth, the church expectant in Paradise
joined in their best and purest strains with
angels, archangeis and principalities in
the one great sung of the universe, ""Glory
to God in the highest.""
""The reason of the singing,"" he sr.id, ""is
the marvelous object lesson which men call
the incarnation, of which one of the deep
est mysteries seems to be that the Infinite
God could condescend to learn by expe
rience the joys and temptations of mortal
men. and this incarnation for the glory of
God in these ways; that the infinite thus
has fellowship with the finite; that he
takes such wonderful and beautiful means
of bringing back his children to himself;
that he has made it possible for his chil
dren to know divine fellowship, and that
throug.li the incarnation he has imparted
somewhat his character to us Irs children.
""Peaoe on earth means peace with God,
peace in the world,"" under which an appeal
was made ""for peace among the nations of
the earth to-day, in neighborhoods, in
families ana each one with himself."" And
then as the echo of the angels' song, men
come to learn that only men of good will
can appreciate and setfarward this divine
peace.""
The musical accompaniment to the ser
vice was rendered by a vested choir of
nigbteen boys and eieht men, under the
direction of Henry Kirk White Jr. The
music was largely an- arrangement by
Tours, comprising famihar Christmas
hymns.
Ladies of the church decorated the inter
ior with Christinas greens beautifully, the
chancel being a mass of evergreens and
the walls ornamented with garlands run
ning round them. The font was full of
fresh cut flowers.
TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY.
Rev. W. H. Koreland'a Text From the Annun
ciation by the Shepherds.
The floral decorations of St. Luke's
Episcopal Church were elaborate and
artistic. Evergreen--, and real berries wete
banked around the windows and the en
tire nave was garianded with alternate
wreaths and crosses of mistletoe and
holly.
Services were held at 7, 8 ana 11 o'clock
in the morning, and all were attended by
crowded congregations. During the day
over &"">0 members received communion.
At 11 o'clock the full choir sang sweetly
ana impressively under the directorship of
Choirmaster W. A. Sahin.
Rev. William Hall Moreland preached
the Christmas sermon from the text
""Behold, I bring you good tidings of great
joy."" He said in part:
""There is a tendency at Christmas to
dwell upon externals and to miss ttie true,
deep meaning of ttie day. One of the in
direct and beneficent effects of Christmas
is trie observation of the day by Jews and
non-believers. Multitudes are blessed by
Christmas who are not yet ready to ac
knowledge Hi.:i from whom all the bless
ings come. When we think of it. as a.
religious festival our thoughts are occu
pied with its externals. We picture the
manger, we sing of the angels, we join in
the hymns and say 'How sweet, how
beautiful,' and pay little heed to the mean
ing of the words in use.
""You are the child of God; you are not
left to perish here, because he has come
among you and taken your nature and
lived your life and redeemed and saved
you.""
GERMAN CHURCH.
After a Musical Fete Kris Kringle Distrib
uted Keepsakes.
A very pretty Christmas entertainment
was given last evening at the Eraanuel
Evangelical Church on Twelfth street, of
which Rev. H. Corde s is pastor. The fete
was under the direction of Superintendent
G. P. Ochs and his corps of teachers. The
exercises were in the German language
and a programme of thirty numbers was
rendered in excellent style, the singing
bein^r particularly meritorious.
Tne feature of the entertainment was a
cantata founded on tne parable of the
""ten virgins."" The house of the bride
groom had been set with stage effects at
one side of the pulpit, and ten young
ladies robed in white carrying lighted
antioue lamps personated the virgins.
At the proper moment five of the lamps
went out for nan' of oil, and with a wail
ing chorus the ""Foolish Virgins"" were
consigned to outer darkness. Miss Carrie
Senk acted as doorkeeper to the bride
groom's house, and the virgins were
Misses Tillie and Laura Otto, Tillie
and Frieda Meineke, Lillie Koebelin,
Emma Jenne, Ida Oprecht, Christine Dall
and Tillie and Kate Kohler.
During tlie evening Misses Emma and
Amy Fischer, daughters of Rev. F.
W. Fischer, a missionary lately re
turned from Japan, sang the Japanese
national anthem and some Gospel hymns
in the Japanese language. The two girls
were born in Japan and wore the native
costume. The entertainment closed with
the appearance of Kris Kringle, who threw
candies among tne audience and dis
tributed presents from a brilliantly lighted
tree.
ST. MARKUS LUTHERAN.
Choice Vooal and Instrumental Musio— Rev. J.
Fuendeling's Sermon.
At St. Mark us German Evangelical Luth
eran Church there were elaborate services,
consisting of excellent choral and organ
music. An organ prelude by Rinck began
the exercises, and was followed by the
singing of the hymn ""0, for a Thousand
Tongues."" The musical programme also
comprised ""Kyrie,"" by Reinecke, ""Gloria
Patria,"" by C. Greith, ""Gloria in Excelsis,""
by Ant. P. Suriano. ""Noel,"" by Adam, a
Christmas anthem by Werner, ""Lord, How
Shall I Be Meeting?"" the Christmas chorus,
""This Is a Faithful Saying"" and apostlude
by Bach.
Rev. J. Fuendeling preached from the
text, ""Behold, I bring you good tidings
of great joy."" In the course of hi 3 sermon
he asserted that people were too much in
clined to forget or icrnore the significance
of the coming of Christ, and kept them
selves too far apart from God, except on
special occasions and days of worship.
The edifice of the congregation is a new
one. which was completed only last March,
and this was consequently the first Christ
mas service held therein."" The decorations
were few, only the chancel and altar being
irarlnnded with choice flowers and vines.
But the absence of floral decorations was
in reality the evidence of extreme good
taste, as the highly artistic finish of the
interior is all-sum'cient. its chaste and
simple white and gold being in exquisite
harmony with the richly colored stained
glass windows.
SALVATION ARMY PEAST.
Nearly Two Thousand People Fed at the
Old Wigwam.
The Salvation Army gave a feast to the
unprovided at the old Wigwam Theater,
corner of Geary and Stockton streets, yes
terday. Fully 2000 people came in re
sponse to the general invitation issued by
tie array, ami all feasted to t.e full.
There were ten tables laden with roast
turkey, beef, mutton and delicacies innu
merable. For several hours the good men
and women in charge of the festival ca
tered to the wants of their grateful pa
trons. There was great rejoicing, both
among those who carved and served the
turkey those who dispatched the bird.
Packages of fruit and candy were given
toeach person as the procession of thank
ful souls passed out. There were toys for
the children and wholesome articles for
the elder folk.
The feast was indeed a pronounced suc
cess, and Ensign McFee and his comrades
have reason to feel proud of their achieve
ment.
At St. Joseph's.
There was a peculiarly impressive ser
vice at St. Joseph's, Tenth and Howard
streets. The altar, brilliant with illumi
nated candles, was decorated tastefully
with hollyberries, tearoses and mossroses.
Rev. Father McDonnell celebrated mass.
Key. Father Collins delivered a sermon.
His text was ""Glory to God in the highest
und on earth peace to men of good will.""
A large congregation was edified by the
eloquent discourse.
At the City Prison.
The Supervisors sent several turkeys to
the City Prison yesterday, and Sergeant
Lindheimer contributed a big pig. which
was roasted and eaten along with the
turkeys by the prisoners and ""trusties,""
who thoroughly enjoyed their Christmas
dinner.
SOME POPULAE UXPBESSIONS.
Curiosities of American Speech Accord-
Ing to a Dialect Society.
Is a pancake fried or baked, or simply
cooked? Is it, after all, really a pancake
and not rather a griddle cake, a flannel
cake, a buckwheat or a flapjack? What is
a doughnut? When you tear your trous
ers on a sharp point what is the first word
you instinctively apply to the rectangular
rent; tramp patch, barn door or weewary,
as says the New Englander, or is it a win
klehawk, or nicklehawk, as New Yorkers
fay? What do you mean by dingbats?
How widespread is the use of the shimmy?
Such are the problems set by the American
Dialect Society in part eight of its notes,
which will be published m a few days.
Three distinct recipes for tlie preparation
of doughnuts are promulgated by the so
ciety. Dough, raised with yeast, sweet
ened and spiced, cut into cubes, which,
when fried in a deep vessel with hot fat,
become round lumpy, forms the doughnut
of Connecticut. By substituting soda or
saleratus for yeast, and cutting the paste
into circles or twists, you have tho douirh
nut of Massachusetts, which the Dutch
pettier calls the olykoek and others tlie
cruller; while the native of Connecti
cut distingaisnes between the twisted biled
I cake and the round jumble. If merely
unseasoned dough be used you have the
fried bread of Massachusetts, called in
Cape Cod seventy-fours, ami elsewhere, it
seems, doughnuts. The dingbat has had
an adventurerous career. Starting as a
ball of dirt on the legs of sheep in Ver
mont, it becomes a smart spank to the
Northern New Englander, a squabble, a
flying missile and money to tue Maine
lumberman, the bis-cuit of the New Eng
land boarding-school, while in Georgia it
has turned to a mother's kiss, and you
may say of the girl you admire, ""She is a
regular dingbac.""
It must not be inferred that culinary and
domestic matters alone engross the so
ciety's attention, though it is at home
that the careless words and phrases are
most likely to be used which deviate from
literary forms, but have passed from mouth
to mouth since the man lirst spoke. This
part of dialect notes contains no less than
♦JOO new words and usages, collected
throughout the land, some poetical, toar.y
picturesque and all curious and interesting.
In the Tennessee mountains, streams
flowing from the east are sunrise waters, a
mule that you can trust is a confidential
mule, a railroad train is a smoke wagon, a
kiss is a sniouch, cheese is plural, with a
singular chee, sugar is sweetening; a man
subject to lits is fkined, ana very much is
a heap sight, or a good few, or some sev
eral, or way yander. A man points
to a hillside and tells you that he
""lives on yon coast"" and has a ""good
scope of land,"" he greets you with ""How
do you come on ?"" and asks you to ""Come
in and rest your hat."" A toothbrush to
him means a snuffstick, ill mrans cross,
juberous timid, liisy mean, popular styl
ish, his past tenses are fotcli aiid holp and
seed and squez and swole; he tells you
that ""sickness is mighty interruptiii',""
that it is ""a gosh wet spell;"" and ""hit's
too-my-goodness cold,"" that he has ""the
bcatenest boy and talkenest old woman
you ever see,"" and that that young flirt is
""tryin' to get a chaw on a feller.""
The sky-baked or stay-at-home Jersey
matron coasters or potters around the
house, calls her preserves do-ups, pork
spack, her husband, if need be, a iobscoiiFe
or loper, meaning a worthless fellow. She
sides up or cleans up or goes struling,
wasting time about the village, but siie
cares not a Dutch cuss about coing down
country, that is to New York City.
Coof is the name for an off-islander in
Nantucket, on Mount Desert the summer

Superfluous Kating.
Growth and waste and repair go on in a
nearly uniform way the whole year
through, but the amount necessary for
these operations or purposes is surpris
ingly small. The generation of bodily
heat requires a most variable quantity
of food. In winter, with the tem
perature of the external air at zero,
the temperature of the blood in
healthy persons is 95.3 degrees; and when
the heat of summer drives the mercury of
tne thermometer nearly to or above that
mark, the blood still register 98.3 decrees.
The marvelous mechanism by which this
uniform blood temperature is maintained
at all seasons is not necessary to consider;
but it must bo evident to every one that
the force needed to raise the temperature
of the whole body to nearly 100 degrees in
winter is no longer needed in the summer.
The total amount of food needed for re
pair, for growth and for heating, physiol
ogy teaches us, is much less than is gener
ally imagined, and it impresses us with the
truth of the great surgeon Abernethy's
saying, that ""one-fourth of what we cut
keeps us. and the other three-fourths we
keep at the peril of our lives."" In winter
we burn up the surplus food with a lim
ited amount of extra exertion. In sum
mer we get rid of it literally at some extra
risk to health, and. of course, to life. We
cannot burn it. Our vital furnaces are
banked, and we worry the most important
working organs with the extra exertion of
removing what would better never have
been taken into the stomach.— British

THE MONADNOCK
IN COMMISSION
Claimed to Be the Most
Powerful Battle-Ship
Afloat.
THE SIMPLE FORMALITY.
Captain Sumner Reads Secretary
Herbert's Orders and As
sumes Command.
PATRIOTIC AIES BY THE BAND.
Stars and Stripes Flutter in the
Breeze and the Ceremony.lls
Over.
VALLEJO, Cal., FeD. 20.— At 9a. m. the
Tinted States navy was auemented by
what many officers believe to be the most
powerful battle-ship atloat, the double
turreted monitor Monadnock.
Promptly at that hour all the officers of
the new ship assembled on her afterdeck,
the martial figure of her commander, Cap
tain G. W. Sumner, standing conspicu
ously alone. The Marine band was near
by and Commodore 11. L. Howison and
staff occupied stations appropriate.
Captain Sunnier ordered the new crew
to assemble in front of his group and to
them and his brother officers he read in a
calm strong voice Secretary Herbert's
official letters, formally ordering the
Monadnock into commission and his orders
to assume charge of her and the officers
and men assigned to her.
As Captain Sumner's orders died away,
the beautiful melody of ""The Star-span
gled Banner"" Heated sweetly over the wa
ter and gracefully the Stars and Stripes
arose and, expanding to the morning
breeze, told the world that another gallant
craft was ready to carry it to victory and
glory.
Tiie Monadnock is about ready for her
trial trip, which will be made in a few
days. Her twenty-six officers and 145 men
will proceed at once to make themselves
at home.
The men were called off in watches they
are to keep for the next three years.
The wardroom and galley utensils were
chipped from the New York yard to-day,
and for the present the officers wiil use
mess gear from the Baltimore. For the
next couple of days the men will mess on j
board of the Independence. A lighter of;
coal is now alongside, and the bunkers
will soon be filled. No orders have been |
received and it is not known when she may i
be ordered from the yard, as the detail of i
the trial board has not yet reached the j
yard from Washington.
The following officers have so far report
ed for duty on the Monadnock: Captain
George ""\V. Suraner, Lieutenant-Command
er E. D. Tausig, Lieutenant J. M. Roper,
Lieutenant Albert Gleaves, Lieutenant
(j. g. ) Stokely Morgan, Lieutenant (j. g.)
A. If. Beecher, Ensign 'M, L. Miller,
Ensiirn R. S. Douglas, Surgeon J. S. Steele,
Paymaster S. R. Calhoun, Chief Engineer
Absalom Kirby, Assistant Engineer F. D.
Head. Acting Gunner J. W. Bullas, Acting
Carpenter G. J. Shaw.
The monitor is considered one of tne
best made ships of war in the service, and
many words of commendation were
expressed by tne workmanlike appearance
as witnessed from the dock alongside of
which the monitor is now lying. The
stores will be sent on board at once.
FOOTBALL, AT FALLEJO.
An Exciting Game la Expected on TTash-
inpton'a Birthday.
VALLEJO, Cal., Feb. 20.— There prom
ises to be an exciting game of football at
Vallejo on Washington's birthday between
Farragut eleven of Vallejo and the St.
Mary's College eleven of Oakland.
It will be remembered that the St. Mary's
buys defeated the Farraguts just a year
ago, and since then the Farraguts have
strengthened their team considerably, and
have won several games during the past
•eason; in fact, they have only been de
feated twice since they have been organ
ized—once by the St. Mary's team, then by
the Peerless eleven (comprising some of
the best players of the Olympics) after a
hard-fought game.
The Farraguts and St. Mary's are pretty
evenly matcued. for Saturday's game, and
those who have seen the Farraguts play
are of the opinion that the St. Mary's
eleven will have their hands full when they
go on the eridiron at Vallejo.
The St. Mary's have with them such good
men as Hanlon, Huff and McHugh, who
greatly assisted the Reliance team in scor
ing so many victories the past season.
The make-up of the teams is as follows:

seventh innine the score was tied 'by the

peciallv interesting for good batting and
poor fielding. Sharp captained the fresli
men and Harry Reynolds the seniors.
BASEBALL AT 8 TAXFOR D.
liaising Money to Secure the Services of a
lily Chicago Coach.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., FeD.
20. The baseball management has hit
upon another plan for raising money, but
it is the threadbare method of voluntary
subscriptions, and whether it will result in
the production of sufficient money is a
question. The management is desirous of
securing the services of William Lange,
the big Chicago fielder and catcher, as a
coach for the baseball nine. If enough
money can be raised, Lange will teach the
players what he can about our National
game.
The first inter-class field day will take
place on February 29 between the sopho
mores and freshmen. Events have not yet
been decided upon, but a large number of
men of both classes are working to bo in
shape to enter the competition.
SUICIDE AT M'OKA SE.
An Aged Man, Tired of Life, Ends Bis
Existence.
SPOKANE, ""Wash., Feb. 20.— Daniel Ga
leucia, aged 65 years, who lives near Chat
taroy, this county, committed suicide this
morning by shooting himself through the
heart with a rifle. The gun was placed
against the wall and the trigger pushed off
with a stick.
His life was somewhat of mystery, it
being said that he once was a man of some
prominence. Ha has lived with an old
man called Peavine Jimmy for the past
eight years. From papers on his person it
is learned that he has a wife at Peabody,
Mass., but neighbors say he was divorced.
Despondency is supposed to be the cause.
THE WILLOWS TRAGEDY.
All the Eye-Witnesses of the
Killing Are Not Compelled
. to Testify.
The Prosecution Announces That It
Is Ready to Rest Its
Case.
WILLOWS, Cal., Feb. 20.-In the
Sehorn murder trial to-day, j. B. Wil
liams continued his testimony as follows:
''I went up to arrest the defendant and
was prevented by one McNorton, who said
he had him under arrest. Loud talking
and a gathering crowd caused me to run
to the scene. The first shot was fired when
I got wfthin six or eight feet. Am Dretty
sure one of the shots was fired around
Mr. Hulett.""
H. W. Walker, son-in-law of deceased,
identified a receipt for $42, signed by the
defendant, June 1, 1895. He had refused
to allow Lawyer Geis to take it away when
he cajne for Sehorn.
G. J. Furnish of Gait testified: ""I was
in Willows on the day of the shooting.
Saw defendant on the evening of the homi
cide. I was on my way to the hotel. De
fendant induced me to turn around and
accompany him to Putman's store, re
marking that Putiuan claimed he owed
him $4; he also said Putman had accused
him of having influenced the Board of Su
pervisors.""
After waiting for half an hour for a wit
ness who did not put in an appearance,
Attorney Swinford announced that the
prosecution rested. The defense was un
prepared for this and begged the court for
a little time to get ready, and were granted
one hour.
Attorney Aibery insisted on the court
compelling the prosecution to put on the
stand all of the eye-witnesses to the
tragedy, which was denied by the court.
Attorney Aibery then outlined the de
fense, saying that the defendant would
show that he was on a perfectly peaceable
mission to settle a bill at the request of
deceased. That when turning to leave the
scene he was dealt a heavy blow and shot
to save his life, as he supposed.
G. J. Furnish testified: ""I was at the
scene of the shooting. Sehorn said, 'If I
owe you $4 I will pay you.' Putman com
menced the difficulty by striking Sehorn
in the face, knocking him partially down.""
Witness was turned over to Swinford for
cross-examination. The witness' testi
mony was very contradictory to that given
at the preliminary examination. At the
hour of recess was making it
exceedingly warm for the witness.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1596.
BRUTAL MURDER
AT REDDING
A Young Man Shot by a
Faro-Dealer Without
Provocation.
HAPPENED IN A SALOON.
The Victim Was Joking With
the Proprietor of the Place
at the Time.
DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE.
The Murderer Is Captured and Nar
rowly Escapes Being
Lynched.
REDDING, Cal., Feb. 20.— This evening
at 6 o'clock a murder was committed at
the Tiger saloon on California street, in
which Johnny Ward was killed and a man
named Ryan is his slayer.
Ryan is a fat Irishman, weighing about
210 pounds. About tvro months ago he
came - here from Oregon, and Bince that
time he has been dealing faro and other
games at the Tiger saloon, owned by John
Neail. At times he would tend the bar
during the absence of the regular bar
keeper. He is a quarrelsome lellow and
about 40 years old.
The victim, Ward, is a young man not
over 26 years of age and has always been
known as a quiet fellow. He was em
ployed in a bridgegang on the Iron Mount
ain Railroad and was a hard worker. To
day he had been drinking around at vari
ous saloons and was in the habit of joking
with the barkeeper about paying for the
drinks, but he invariably put up the cash.
At 6:15 o'clock this evening he sauntered
into the Tiger saloon. He was perlectly
sober and, stepping up to the bar, called
for the drinks for himself and three of his
friends. Ryan was standing near by, but
not drinking.
John Neail, the proprietor, was tending
bar, and after serving the drinks asked,
""Well, who's to pay for these drinks?""
Young Ward remarked in a jocular way,
""Why, you're going to pay for them,"" ad
dressing Neail, at the fame time reaching
his hand in his pocket for the cash.
At this Ryan, who was standing about
four feet away, pulied a pistol from his
pocket, walked straight up in front of
Ward, placed the muzzle at Ward's face
and deliberately iired, remarking as he did
so: ""You , don't you treat
the old man so.""
Ward fell to the floor with a bullet
hole through his cheek and the jugular
vein severed. A tireat pool of blood lay at
his head. He died without a struggle.
The murderer, after firing the shot, broke
and ran through the rear door of the sa
joon and escaped in the darkness. The
officers were notiiied, and in ten minutes
the murderer was found hiding on the
roof of the Welcome Restaurant, on Te
hama street. He was taken down, placed
under arrest and immediately conveyed to
the County Jail.
A great mob followed him to the jail,
eager to get hold of him, but the officers
carefully guarded the prisoner.
Ward and Ryan are said to have been
perfect strangers. It is said by some that
Ward whipped Ryan a year ago, but no
credence is given to the rumor, as Ryan
is twice the size of his victim.
The pistol with which Ryan did the
shooting belonged to Neail and was taken
from behind the bar by Ryan some time
during the day. This afternoon Ryan was
seen to step from the sidewalk in front of
the saloon, pick up a couple of rocks and
put them in his pocket. What this action
meant no one knows.
There are hundreds of Iron Mountain
workmen in town to-night and the feeling
among them runs high against the mur
derer. Should he fall into their hands it
would go hard with him.
The body of the murdered man was re
moved to the Morgue at 7 o'clock and an
inquest is now being held.
Ryan says he pointed the pistol at Ward
simply to intimidate him. He says he
did not know the pistol was a self-cocker
and is sorry for the killing.
""Ward's father is a drayman, living at
Red Bluf|. He has been notified and the
remains will probably be taken there for
burial.
WAS IT PHILIP CROWLEY ?
Desperate Encounter of a San
Jose Constable With a Bold
Highwayman.
The Officer Narrowly Averts Death
and the Prisoner Makes His
Escape.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 20.— A desperate
highwayman made a bold and successful
break for liberty this evening shortly after
8 o'clock and attempted to murder Police
man Monroe.
The affray occurred in the business por
tion of the city at the corner of Santa
Ciara and First streets at a time when the
streets were tilled with people.
The highwayman, whose name is un
known, but who is suspected to be Philip
Crowley, the Alameda outlaw, was ar
rested by Constable Ed Haley on Santa
Clara street. The officer suspected him of
having robbed Charles Berryman, a hack
driver. The latter was held up by a
masked man on the Los Gatos road at 7
o'clock and robbed of a gold watch and $10
in coin.
Mr. Berryman was driving from Los
Gatos and was accompanied by his wife.
The affair was reported to the officers, and
from the description furnished by Berry
man Constable Haley made the arrest.
The robber was a powerful man and
Haley decided to take no chances, so he
drew his pistol and placed the muzzle
against the supposed robber's side.
In this manner he walked with the man
to First street, where he asked Officer
Monroe to take charge of his prisoner for
a few minutes until lie could step across
the street and get Berryman to identify
him.
When Haley turned to go across the
street the robber drew his pistol and
placed it against the officer's abdomen.
Monroe was on the watch, and knocked
the pistol aside and as he did so the robber
hred a shot and the bullet struck the pave
ment.
Monroe had his overcoat buttoned and
was unable to reach for his pistol. He
pulled his club and struck the man over
the head. The burglar then attempted to
shoot the officer in the face and as he did
so Monroe knocked the pistol aside witli
his left arm and struck his assailant with
his club.
The robber then struck at the officer and
fired a shot, the bullet going through
Monroe's coatsleeve. The robber then
made a dash for liberty and ran through
Fountain alley to Second street, pursued
by Officer Monroe and Constables Haley
and Coscnina. A right in the alley fol
lowed, in which twelve shots were fired by
the officers in pursuit.
The robber turned twice and returned
the fire. After leaving the alley he dashed
across Second street and made his escape
through a yard to Third street. During
his encounter in the alley with the
officers he was probably struck by
one of the bullets fired by the officers, for
drops of blood were found four blocks
away where he had gone after his fight
with the officers in the alley. No further
trace of the robber could be found from
this point.
Austrian Colony for Mendodno County.
UKIAH, Cal., Feb. 20.— A party of fifty
four immigrants arrived in this city to
day. They are Austrians and have pur
chased the Eden Valley ranch, forty miles
north of this city. The colony will consist
of nearly 300 families when all shall have
arrived. The leader of the party is a priest
named Father Jeram.
SAN DIEGO IS WAKING UP
Talks of Establishing a Steam
ship Line With Japan
ese Ports.
All the Officers of Ships in the Har
bor to Be Banqueted by
Business Men.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 20.—Consider
able interest is being manifested by busi
ness men in a letter lately received from
Japan looking to the establishment of a
steamship line connecting San Diego with
a Japanese port.
It appears that about all the cotton used
in Japan is obtained in this country and
the proposed line of vessels is to be used
primarily in the transportation of this
class of produce. Since the Japanese con
tracts for cotton in vast quantities were
placed with American firms not long ago,
over 1200 carloads of the product have been
shipped through the port of San Francisco.
The agent of the Japanese manufacturers,
it is reported, is A. H. Butler, formerly of
this city, and whose untiring activity was
at the bottom of the establishment of the
Otav watch-factory plant in one of the
Japanese cities. He recommended this
port to the projectors of the steamshin
line in question and the Chamber of Com
merce has been instructed to keep up an
active correspondence witii the Japanese
representatives.
The Chamber of Commerce took steps at
a meeting to-day looking to a grand ban
quet to be tendered by the business men of
the city to all the officers of the ships in
the narbor. Within a few days the Alert,
Marion and Thetis will be in port, and
their officers, with those of the flagships
Philadelphia, Monterey and Albatross,
will make a goodly number. Thedateof
the banquet bus not oeen fixed, but it will
probably be given within a few days. In
extent and elegance it is intended to make
it like tho banquet given by the business
men of the city several years ago to the
officers of the Itata, Mexican warship
Democrata, and other vessels.
WILD RUSH FOR WEALTH
The Colville Indian Reservation
Opened for the Location of
Mining Claims.
A Repetition of the Exciting Scenes
and Incidents of the Cherokee
Strip.
SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 20.— The intel
ligence that the President had signed the
bill opening half of the Colville Indian
Reservation to the location of minintr
claims was received here a few minutes '
after the signature had been affixed and
from here the news was spread by tele
graph and mounted couriers to thousands
of gold-seekers, who for four days have
been gathering on the borders of the reser
vation waiting to make a rush into the
new gold fields.
When the news reached the various
points a wild scramble for wealth began.
The vast majority are entering that wild
region with no clear idea of where they
will seek the great stores of hidden min
eral known to exist there. They only
want to get there first, somewhere, any
where, so as to get the richest claims. It
is well nigh impossible to prospect that
region at this time owing to snow, but this
fact does not in the least check the mad
desire to join in the rush.
It is only a question of ""sooners,"" as
they will not be able to make any kind of
locations until the snow goes off. Every
one going into the reserve is heavily
armed. It is an open secret that if ""soon
ers"" are found located in advance they
will be run out of the country or given
short shrift. Hundreds are preparing to
leave this city in the morning to join in
the race for wealth.
A MADMAN IN THE PULPIT
Sacramentans Thrown Into a
Panic During the Marshall
Revival Services.
Terrific Struggle With the Officers
Before the Man Was
Overpowered.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 20.-Shoitly
before the commencement of the Marshall
revival services this evening, which are
being held in the Sixth-street Methodist
Church in this city, and while the edifice
was crowded with the waiting congrega
tion, an insane man entered the church
and assumed possession of the pulpit.
After announcing that he had been
anointed by the Creator he began a series
of antics that spread disrnay among the
congregation. The police were sent for
and acting Police Captain Ash and Officer
l>ouglas promptly responded.
A terrific struggle ensued, creating the
greatest excitement among the congrega
tion, but the officers eventually succeeded
in throwing him to the floor and hand
cuffing him, after which he was conveyed
to the police station.
As far as can be learned he is a stranger
in the city. He gives the name of Henry
Bloomington, and when searched at the
station $235 in gold coin was found upon
[his person.
JESSE POTTER
A Motion to Reopen the
Cause Is Denied by-
Judge Buck.
A SENSATION IN COURT.
Potter Held to Be Guilty of Per
jury, but Competent to Act
as Executor.
ORDERS ENTERED BY THE CLERK
There Is Now No Straw to Indicate
How the Litigation Will
End.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Feb. 20.— The
Potter removal suit was before Judge
Buck's court again to-day on a motion
madn by J. H. Campbell, attorney for the
German heirs of the Charles Lux estate,
to reopen the cause for the hearing of
further testimony. Mr. Delmas, who is
associated with Mr. Campbell in this suit,
was absent, and so also was Mr. Pillsbury,
senior counsel for Jesse Sheldon Potter.
Mr. Campbell, in support of his motion,
wished to present the depositions taken
relating to the Sadie Young incident and
the John Brown note, but Mr. Campbell
was interrupted by Mr. McEnerney, who
stated that he would object to the hearing
of the motion, his contention being that
the ten days' notice of riling the motion,
as required bylaw, had not been given,
and that counsel for plaintiff was evi
dently laboring under the idea that five
days' notice was sufficient, as would be the
case if service had only to be made in the
same county in which the suit was
brought.
Mr. McEnerney further argued that an
other motion covering the same matter
was already under advisement, and that
under sections 182 and 183, Code of Civil
Procedure, only one opportunity could be
taken to secure the relief that was desired.
The facts were, that on last Thursday a
motion was made to reopen and introduce
new evidence; an objection was made
and the matter was taken under advise
ment; on the same day a scheme was de
vised by plaintiffs to introduce the depo
sitions in another manner, and it almost
amounted to contempt of court. Under
any circumstances, Mr. McEnerney said,
they had not received the ten days' notice
required by law.
Mr. Campbell therefore glanced through
the codes, and said yes, they had acted
under the assumption of a five days' no
tice, and if ten days were required he
might as well stop right there. At the
same time, the notice was an oversight
tnat had occurred in the routine of office
work and without his knowledge. He
suggested that the matter might be cov
ered by filing a brief.
Judge Buck interrupted Mr. Campbell
and said that the filing of a brief would
not be necessary. He should not grant
the motion anyway, and the question was
not debatable even.
Mr. Campbell said that, unfortunately,
Mr. Delmas was absent, and that as it had
fallen upon Mr. Delmas to conduct the
case, he hoped that an opportunity would
be granted for Mr. Delmas to be heard,
and that Mr. Delmas would not be fore
closed.
Judge Buck stated that he should not
consent to reopen the case. He held that
Jesse Potter had committed perjury, but
he thought with Mr. McEnerney, that the
opinion of Judge de Haven was good,
wherein the latter held that because a per
son has committed perjury, it does not
disqualify him to act as an executor.
This ruling came as a peal of thunder
from a clear sky, because when Judge
Buck announced last Thursday that he
would hold that Jesse Potter had* commit
ted perjury, it was taken as an indication
that Jesse Potter would be made to suffer
accordingly.
At the above point in to-day's proceed
ings Judge Buck directed Court Clerk
Schaberg to enter the following orders:
""In to-day's motion to reopen the Potter
removal suit, Mr. McEnerney's objection
sustained and motion dismissed. In the
motion to reopen made February 13 and
argued by Messrs. Delmas and McEner
ney, motion denied.""
To-day's action throws an element of
uncertainty about the Jesse Potter litiga
tion, and there is now no straw to indicate
which way the decision may go. The
naming of Jess? Potter's successor is ihe
hone of contention. The various Charles
Lux, Jesse Potter, Miller & Lux and out
side interests appear to be pulling togeth
er, but in opposite directions, in hope of
securing the prize.
The ninety day's time within which a
Superior Judge may render a decision does
not expire in this instance until about the
middle of March.
TULARE'S FORTY THIEVES
Joe Middleton, Leader of the Gang,
Is on Trial for Robbery
at Selma.
A Few of His Numerous Criminal Ex
ploits as Narrated by a
Witness.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 20.— Joe Middleton,
a former member of the Tulare forty
thieves gang, who has just completed a
term in the Kings County Jail, had hia
preliminary examination before the Jus
tice of the Peace at Selma to-day, on a
charge of robbing a sheepherder named
Antone Palmitel last June, some miles
south of Selma.
Charles Barlow, a witness for the people,
by the sdvice of Sheriff Buckner of Kings
County, gave some extremely sensational
testimony tending to convict Middleton
not only of the charge against him in this,
but, of many robberies and thefts in Tulare,
Kings and Fresno counties.
In the depredations, Middleton, so wit
ness declared, was associated with E. M.
Jefferds ana Claud Armstrong, both of
whom are now in State prison. He said
that Middleton had formerly been asso
ciated with the famous Dalton gang of
train-robbers. The witness had himself
been an uuwilling witness to some of Mid
dleton's crimes. A striking feature of
Barlow's testimony was that it exactly
coincided with that eiven by the Portu
guese, Palmitel, who had been robbed.
At the conclusion of Barlow's testimony
Mirtdleton was held to the Superior Court
of this county with bail fixed at $.'SOOO,
which he failed to give and is now in jail.
Officers of Doth counties regard Barlow's
testimony as of the greatest importance,
since it clears up ninny cases of theft and
robbery heretofore wrapped in complete
mystery. It is further believed that by
means of Barlow's sworn statement the
remaining portion of this band, which has
been a sore affliction to stockmen in the
counties named for many years, may be
completely broken up.
Barlow, with great deliberation, located
the three rendezvous of the outlaws, which
were at Camp Badger, famed by Evans
and Sontag, ""Wildflower and Tulare Lake.

ARIZONA'S GREAT FIESTA
Her Capital City Thronged With
Visitors From All Parts
of the Coast.
No Such a Celebration Ever Held
Before in the Territory's
History.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 20.— T0-day 20,000
people witnessed the firemen's tourna
ment which took place on Washington
6treet. This morning there were bicycle
races at the park, and most of the prizes
went to Tucson. Slater, the Arizona won
der, was in three races, tut did not get a
place.
The special train carrying the Los An
geles Merchants' Association, 100 strong,
leaves to-morrow for home, having spent
two days here. They say the parade dis
play exceeded anything ever given on the
coast.
A grand fireworks display now illumi
nates the sky as never before in Arizona.
The Maricopa Club is entertaining a large
number of visitors at the banquet hall,
while at the pavilion in the park several
hundred couples are dancing.
To-morrow (Indian day) over a thousand
braves and 700 Indian school children will
participate in the ceremonies. The chil
dren will give a literary showing of the
Indians to-day, while the warriors of all
the Arizona tribes here will show the war
dances, harvest festivities and quaint cus
toms of past generations.
The city is crowded with visitors, yet all
are cared for. A great feature this even
ing was the military parade of three com
panies of soldiers from Foil Whipple, also
National Guards, headed by a military
band. There was a reception at 7 o'clock
in the Governor's chambers at the City
Hall, where hundreds were received.
SANTA BARBARA'S WATER
Assemblyman Barker's Offer to'
Supply the City From
His Tunnel.
The Proposition Will Be Fully Con
sidered and Terms Doubtless
Agreed Upon.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 20.— The
water question received an electric shock
to-day, when a proposition was submitted
to the City Council by James h. Barker,
Assemblyman from this district, offering
to supply the city with water from his
tunnel in Cold Springs canyon, at the rate
of $2000 for the first ten miner's inches,
and $1500 for each additional inch.
Mr. Barker's tunnel, which he began
boring last summer on his own individual
responsibility, is now producing an excess
of twelve and one half inches, and is being
steadily pushed into the mountains with
every prospect of finding new streams as
it progresses. Experts agree that the sup
ply is a permanent one, and as the entire
present supply of the city scarcely exceeds
the flow from the Barker tunnel in the dry
season, the offer becomes an important
one, and will receive serious consideration.
The site of the tunnel being bored at the
expense of the city is only a few hundred
feet from the Barker tunnel, and it is
altogether likely that the city will make
terms with Mr. Barker and unite the sup
ply from both tunnels in one supply pipe.

41 STUKJF LUCK,""
A Mining Man Falls Right on
His Feet in This State.
Found Some Camps |That Did Not
""Pan Out.""
mHERE ARE A FEW THINGS IN THE
-*- world that will stand as landmarks as long
as the English language is spoken, and not an
inconspicuous one is the typical Californian
gold-miner. He has fewer traits that leave a
disagreeable memory than most of the rugged
types of the world; and he has more of the
genuine manly spirit than most people who get
lauded for their conspicuous bravery. Accus-
tomed to face hard times as well as ""the har-
vest of plenty,"" ho learns, without knowing it
almost, to sympathize with the ""weak and
weary."" And when things do not look par-
ticularly roseate with Him he accepts the con-
dition of affairs with a complacency that is
matchless as well as admirable. One of the
younger men who to-day are to be found try-
ing to carve out for themselves ""name and
fame"" in the mines is Mr. A. Burton, who is
now in the great gold-bearing section of Grass
Valley. Mr. Burton is an honest, good-natured
fellow. He has had nis share of misfortune,
too, and when a few months ago he wa< stricken mr
right in the middle of his work with a most
dangerous disease it seemed as though fate had
determined to ""down him."" But he Imme-
diately, ""struck out"" for the Hudson Medical
Institute, the institution which has become so
famous on account of the. wonderfully clev. r
work of the specialists practicing there, and as
& result he is back at work again, and thank-
ful for what has been done for him. He has
written as follows to the managers:
GRASS VALLEY, Cal, Aug. 15, 1895.
Hudson Medical Institute. San Francisco. Cal.—
Gentlemen: I have received three letters from
you which were sent to Downieville. I have been
to Gold V alloy aiiH.to Nevada and through nearly
all the mining camps ever since, and that was the
reason that I did not Ret my mail before. The
medicine that I took did me lots of gooi, and I
shall soon send lor some more. Youth respect-
iully, . A. BURTON.
So although Mr. Burton has not ""struck it
very rich"" in the mining camps recently he
certainly made no mistake when he becam* J^
sick as to where to go. But every one has the
same experience who applies to this ""Mecca
for all the sick"" for assistance. Thousands o?
testimonials bear out the absolute truth of this
assertion. For instance:
■F. Minturn, St. Louis, Mo. : ""I desire to ex-
press my sincere thanks for the careful ar.
conscientious manner in, which my case hi,
been treated by you.""
5. M. Hooker of Los Angeles ■writes: ""I no'.r
feel as though I am a cured and a well mar. '
K. C. Taft of Stowe, Cal., says: ""lamfeelic;;
fine without a sign of disease now.""
G. 11. Bent: ""By the time I get the medi
taken that I have now I don't think that I will
need any more.""
It is a satisfactory thing to see all these ex-
pressions of good opinion and good ■vrtll coming
in, as they do, by the hundreds daily to the
physicians of the great Hudson Institute, af-
fording further proof that if you are suffering
from any curable disease -there is no place
where you will get help so PROMPTLY and
SATISFACTORILY.

UNCLE SAM'S BIG REINDEER FARMS.
From all that can be learned, it would seem as if UieUnited States Government's
experiment of breeding reindeer in Alaska has turned into a failure. Certain it is
that it has prored to be a disappointment at one station and the animals are known
to have not ""done wt 11"" at the other, but the exact state of affairs cannot be learned
until the revenue cutters get bac£ from the Arctic nexi fall.
The experiments of breeding reindeer must be conceded to be the greatest enter
prise of a paternal nature ever undertaken by the United States Government. It
ranks in importance with the ""Freedraen's"" schools which were established during
the CiviJ War for the purpose of educating the negroes, althougn it is not likely thai
the. cost ran so high. There is no doubt, however, tha: both of them took vast sums
of money.
A crsual estimate of the amount of money spent on the reindeer enterprise
would place it at about $2,000,000. It is to be hoped that all this is not lv,st, as in that
event there would be great discouragement to such enterprises in the future.
It is about seven years since the reindeer experiment was hm heard of and the
■ mount of attention and work that has been given to it since then is enormous.
Considerable mention was made of it in the newspapers for a couple of years after
the enterprise was started, bnt lately the subject seems to hove been forgotten.
The man who started the experiment so hopefully is now the first to declare it a
failure, on one station at least.
Tbe cause which prompted the enterprise was, as everybody might Know, the scar
city of draught animals in Alaska. Horses and mules couid not stand the climate
except in very few sections, and then they needed great care and comfortable stabling,
which two essentials are not easy to provide in a country that is frozen up during the
greater part 'of the year. Does, of course, were to be had in plenty and the little
feKows were able to do good work, but not of the kind demanded. They could drag a
email sled with a miner's outfit on it for miles and miles over hnrd, frozen snow;
but when it came to drawing heavy machinery they were not equal to the task. Some
other animal was needed. Oxen were tried, and failed worse than horses, owing to
their weight, which made them sink deep in soft snow.
The Government officials realized that if Alaska were to be improved and event

n«ily become a State worthy of a stand.
fats with the others in the Union some
draft animal must be provided. As in
every other new country the transporta
tion problem here was of the first consid
eration, and when David Johnson advo
cated the importation and breeding of
reindeer for this purpose his idea met
with ready approval.
Mr. Johnson was a man of vast experi
ence in the Northwest, and knew all about
reindeer and where they were t) be ob
tained. They were not indigenous to that
part of Alaska where they were needed, j
but there seemed no reasons- why they
should not thrive there. In fact, it seetued
as if they shuuld do splendidly, as the
climate was milder than in Siberia, their
native country.
The work done by reindeer in Siberia is
wonc'e-fu!. A pair of males in good health

Californian in its tenor. A ready response was received from
twenty- four artists with homes stretching from San Francisco
to New York.
A further condition was that the contestants be in some
way, directly or indirectly, connected with the State University,
and thus the contest was limited to the confines of the institu-
tion. From the Mark Hopkins Art Institute came the greater
portion of the work submitted, while from the class in indus-
trial drawing at Berkeley a number were received. It was a
coincidence that in the sealed contest Sidney Armer of the
Mark Hopkins school should receive the first prize and that
L. N. Scammon of the Berkeley department the second prize,
the San Francisco department being first and the Berkeley
school second in rank.
On the whole the designs reflected much credit upon the
originality and artistic conceptions of the competitors. Many
that were meritorious from an artistic standpoint fell short of
the stated requirements for pure black and white, some being
colored, others being too fine in detail for reproduction, while
others were too pictorial in effect to produce that reitfulness to
the eye that comes only from the simple and the unpretentious.
The conception of the first-prize winner is excellently
wrought and is a worthy creation both from the point of view
need little food and appear to be indifferent to cold. In addition they are tractable
as horses, and always willing to wort. To put it plainly they are Jo»t what is needed
i i Al&sku
Of course there was considerable red tape to be gone through with before Congress
made tbe necessary appropriations, but after that was done the work went on
smoothly. _
The revenue cutter Bear was detailed on the work, and started from San Francisco
early in 1800. The wort done in the summer of that year was simply to select points
for stations, in which some assistance was given by the survey steamer Patterson.
Five stations were selected, the principal ones being Port Clarence and leller station.
The lollowing year, 1891, buildings were erected and a few reindeer brought to
their new homes from the northern shores of Siberia. Crews were procured for these
stations and left with enough provisions to last them until spring. On the Govern
ment books the keepers of these stations had about the same standing as lighthouse-,
keepers, although the pay was much smaller. Most of the crews were Esquimaux.
In 1892 the revenue cutter Bear was in the north early. The reindeer that had
been left at the different stations the previous fall were found in the best of condition,
and if any change was observable it was an improvement. The animals seemed good
natured and contented, consequently the officers of the Bear felt encouraged to pro
ceed with the work. During that summer the Bear made two trips to Siberia
and came back each time loaded with reindeer. On one trip 178 were obtained
in Siberia and 175 landed in good condition at Port Clarence. Three died on the
trip, whicn is considered a remarkably small number considering how much the
animals were out of iheir element while on shipboard.
The officers of the Bear had no trouble in obtaining all the reindeer they wanted
on any of their trips. They got most of them in exchange for rifles, ammunition,
provisions and articles of clothing.
Last fall when the U. S. cutters got back from the Arctic the officers stated that the
deer were not doing very well. They had not bred as rapidly as was expected and
seemed to be ailing in different ways. It is apparent now that the trouble must hare
been serious it that time as the following dispatch, which has already appeared in
the San Francisco newspapers, will show:
TACOMA.Wash., May 23.— David John
son, who has been in Northwestern
Alaska for six years, has just arrived on
tbe Sound en route to Chicago on a vaca
tion. He reports the Government's herd
of reindeer in the vicinity of Teller station
dying at an alarming rate from ""footrot.""
Many that do not die have to be killed
because of the decaying of their feet.
Although the dispatch only refers to
Teller station it is quite probable that iht
same or a similar state of affairs prevails
at the other stations. The conditions are
about the same at all of the stations.
There are spring thaws that leave the
ground wet. Tni3 causes all trie trouble,
aa the reindeer, accustomed to the hard
ice and snow of Siberia, suffer from damp
ness. It is to be hoped that something can
be done to save the herds. If they could
be removed to a place in the mountains
where there is snow all the time the
trouble might be overcome. This would,
of course, cost large sums of money, but
better spend that than have tbe enter
prise turn out a flat failure.

A third design was- that submitted by Mrs. Alice Curtis of

details too numerous for successful reduction to the scale

list of those' receiving honorable mention.
A fourth design was that of !• Miss Maud Wilkinson of .

conventionalized that its relation to the original is lost sight of.
While the design lacks balance and /equal distribution, the ac-
curacy with which the details are executed make it worthy of
honorable mention. . ~ •
In the remaining designs offered, various other features of
California life, places, events f and prod acts were depicted. In
one is a croup of the university buildings, in another two
grizzly bears supporting a medallion on which is inscribed the
university emblem, on another is a Jesuit of 1770, and beside

A Postmaster-General in the Golden State.
One of the many valuable historical
documents which the late Frank McCop-
I>iti had in his possession was an order
establishing the office nf Postmaster-Gen
eral in California in 1848. Very few people
are aware that California, a mere State,
ever boasted a Postmaster-General. Wil
liam V. Voorhies was his name, and, by
virtue of the commission he held from the
chief of the Postoffice Departmental Wash
ington he was authorized to establish
and maintain a postal system west of the
Rocky Mountains. This was nearly filty
years ago. The result of his labors has
been practically obliterated by the rapid
growth and development of tho Pacitic
Slope and his identity lost sight of, until
a historical document came to light the
other day which on its face shows the re
sponsible and stupendous task he under
took to perform.
The document referred to is the com
mission of William V. Voorhies from
the then Postmaster-Genera), C. Johnson,
""to act as agent for the United States
Government in making arrangements for
the establishment of postoffices and for
the transmission, receipt and conveyance
of letters in California."" It is dated No
vember 1, 1848, and subsequent events
show that ""Agent"" or Postmaster-General
Voorhies was not long in getting into the
held.
The interesting old relic came recently
into the possession of Postmaster McCop
pln, it having been sent to him by a gen
tleman living in Sonoma. Where the com
mission has been since the time of Mr.
Voorhies would be hard to tell, the last
owner merely writing that he found it
stowed away in an old trunk, ana had no
knowledge as to how long it had been
there or where it came from.
It is a curious old document, written in
a girlish hand, upon legal cap paper, and
neatly tied with green ribbon, from which
the luster has long since faded. They did
not have typewiiting machines in those
days, but there can be no rightful com
plaint on that score, for the cbirography
is exceedingly legible, despite its age.
The commission itself is interesting
reading, as it outlines tne establishment
of a postal system in California thai could
grow and expand wilh the growth and ex
pansion of the country without entailing
an extra expense at any time on the
country. The document reads aa follows:
him a miner of 1849, with the Mission Church ann the gold
fields behind them, while still another has for its central
features two students — a boy and a girl — representing co-educa-
tion.
Still others are wrought in fanciful manners, wherein
figures of men, after the Aubrey Beardsley style, are the
features. One particularly meritorious design represents the
maiden ""California"" springing forth full grown from the Heart
of a beautiful srolden poppy.
Taking the contest as a whole, it is the general expression
of opinion that great credit is reflected upon the art depart-
ments of the State University. Botn from the standpoint of
originality and accuracy of detail, some of the designs offered
rival closely the work of Eastern schools of longer standing and
greater facilities. Will C. Russell.

Postofkice Department,)
November 1, 1848. {
Sir: Being authorized by an act of Congress
approved 14th August. 1848, to employ an
agent in making arrangements for the estab
lishment,of postoffices and for the transmis
sion, receipt and conveyance of letters in
California, I hereby appoint you such agent.
The duties with which you are to be charged
will not be confined to any one branch of the
department. They will embrace whatever
may appertain to the operations of the con
tract, appointment and fiscal bureaus of the
department in California.
A route having been created by law and the
same being put in operation by the employ
ment of steamships extending along the
whole coast of Caltfornia, your first duty will
be to proceed to the selection of suitable per
sons for Postmasters at San Diego, San Pedro,
Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Monterey
and at such other points on the Pacific at
which the United States steam mail packets
shall touch as may need such appointments.
For San Francisco a Postmaster has already
been appointed— Samuel York At Lee Esq. —
who will repair by the first opportunity to
that place. Of course, you will not take steps
for appointing Postmasters at any of the
above named places on finding that the ap
pointments would be inexpedient or unneces
sary by reason of not having a mail supply or
for any other cause.
On making such selection you will report
the same to the department at Washington
for appointment, in the meantime placing tne
nominee in the performance of the duties of
his office by a temporary letter of appoint
ment, signed by yourself, to cease on receiv
ing a commission from the Postmaster-Gen
eral or official information ;.hat the appoint
ment has been refused. With your report of
the nomination of any postmaster you will
forward his band, duly executed by himself
and sureties, certified by you to be sufficient
and filled with such an amount as you shall
deem adequate for the case. You will also
cause him to be duly sworn on entering upon
his duties.
You will make report by every mail of the
condition and prospects of the business under
your charge, and will be careful at the expira
tion of each quarter to render those official
returns which « ill show the state of all pecu
niary arrangements of the department in Cal
ifornia, and the indebtedness and credits of
each party, whether postmaster, contractor or
others; and to keep the PoUmaster-General
advised from time to time of the itate and prog
ress of settlements in the country, and what
routes should ba created by law to furnish
them with the mail.
The postage for California is 40 cents on
each single letter (which is a letter not ex
ceeding hall an ounce in weight) between any
place in California and any place on the At

lantic coast, and| 12> 2 cents between any
places on the Pacific. Double, treble letters
and so on, will be cbargable with double,
treble and ihe like increase in rates. lam re
spectfully, your obedient servant,
C. Johnson, Postmaster-General.
William V. Vookhies Esq., Present.
Evidently when Mr. Voorhies arrived
in California he found that his chief in
formation on the needs of the country
was incorrect, for although he established
nine postottices in this State during 1849,
only one point suggested by Postmaster-
General Johnson was included in the list.
Of course the rush of gold-hunters which
occurred about that time must have had
some effect upon the selection of settle
ments that could support postoffices ac
cording to the Postmaster-General's ideas.
The points at which offices were located
in 1849 are as follows: Monterey, Salt
Lake, Vernon, Stock on, San Jose, Colo
ma, Sacramento City, Benicia and So
noma.
It was not until April, 1849, that San
Francisco had a postmaster. Samuel
Yorke At Lee, the gentleman mentioned
in the commission, refused to venture into
the far West, as did also Stephen J.
Dallas, who was appointed twelve days
later and John W. Geary commissioned
January 22, 1849. Jacob B. Moore finally
accepted the appointment or Postmaster
at San Francisco, assuming the duties of
office April 18, 1849. He served until
March 26, 1853, when he was succeeded by
Thomas J. Henley. Since then the :ol
lowins postmasters have served in tn-s
City, the date of appointment being after
their names:
Charles L. Weller, July 10, 1854; Sam
uel H. Parker, April 4, 1861; Richard F.
Perkins, January 25. 1864; Holland Smith,
July 25. 1868; James Coey, May 31, I860;
N. B. Stone, May 17, 1870; James Coey,
March 30, 1874; Samuel Backus. May £2.
1882; W^tem J. Bryan, June 21, 1886;
Samuel Backus, May 14. 1890; Frank Me-
Coppin, August 4y 1894, who held the
office until his death last Wednesday.
William V. Voorhies served as Post
master-General of the Pacific Coast until
1860, when he returned to tne East, finally
settling in Ohio, where he died a few
years ago. Colonel J. D. Fry*, now presi
dent ol the California Safe Deposit and

In trying to cure the sick man of Tur

San Francisco merchants should get the

The surest way to guard against scurvy
in the gold districts of Alaska is to take
along plenty of California preserved fruit
with your rations.
It may be as well to remind the Sena
tors on the Democratic side that we were
promised the new tariff on the Ist of last
June— not next June.
Nearly all the gold of the north will
come to California to be minted and put
into circulation, and those who attend to
business here will get their share of it.
It requires a very tough gall to enable a

The tariff will give to California indus

received before, and still the Democratic

The report of the work of the year on
the Valley road shows good progress,
rapid progress and progress in the right
direction — and what is best of all, the
work goes on and the progress continues.
The fact that the Government loses
$100,000 a day by tho debate on the tariff
is perhaps the very reason why the Demo
crats insist on discussing it at length. A
revenue deficiency would suit them well.
Reports from Washington are to the
effect that there is an unusually large de

this is regarded as a sure proof that retail

reviving throughout the country.
The burden of the blame for the Trans

The pioneers of Utah have many things

Horace Boies, having declared the Chi

The statement that the British press is
trying to pick a quarrel with the United
States will not alarm us to any extent.
Whenever Great Britain wishes a row
with ns she can have it We are quite
ready to annex the Kiondyke country and
all the Canadian accessories. '
The British were profuse in expressions
of friendship for America when the arbi
tration treaty was under consideration,
but now that we ask them to stick to
their agreement for the protection of the
seals they talk back at us like a pugilist
seeking a reputation.
THE. COMMERCIAL OPENING.
The gold discoveries in Alaska and British Colombia open opportunities for profit
to many classes of people, but to none are the opportunities offered more promising
than to the merchants of San Francisco. This port should be made the central
depot of supplies for the whole of the gold region of the north. The market will be
an increasing one and the ptospective profits are not only large, but as safe as any
commercial venture can be. ' 'j.i'.l
The golden fruit bangs temptingly in the northern fields, but is not one that will
drop into our mouths if we wait for it. We will have competitors in the field and we
must enter the contest with every force at our control if we hope to attain success.
San Francisco, as the chief port of this part of the Pacific Ocean, has many advan
tages to aid her in the struggle, but they are not sufficient to make up for any lack of
enterprise and vigor. If we wait even but a short time, our smaller but more ener
getic rivals in Portland, Tacoma and Seattle will enter before us and reap the
harvest.
That the Alaskan market will be worth competing for is beyond question. After
every allowance is made for exaggeration in the reports which have coma to us of the
richness of the gold fields, enough will remain to make it certain that great wealth
will be taken from the mines of those countries for many years to come.' Wherever
there are rich placers there is richer quartz. Before the placers are exhausted, there
will be good transportation facilities to the upper Yukon, and quartz mining will
then begin on aseale which will assure the maintenance of a considerable popula
tion if not permanently, at least for so long a period that the trade will be one of the
most important on the Pacific Coast for the rest of this generation. ■ ■.-.--
The conditions of life are such in the new gold regions as to create a demand for
fruit. In cold countries where the people are compelled to consume large quantities of
fat and greasy foods for the maintenance of warmth of the b.dy .curvy is always im
minent. The surest preventive of that disease is the habitual use of fruit
foods, and California is prepared to furnish them in larg. quantities ana of tno best
quality.
In addition to the necessary supplies of fruits and other food there will be, of
course, a large and increasing demand for minine implements and machinery and for
all kinds of miners' equipments. These things the manufacturers and merchants of
San Francisco have been handling ever since the settlement of tha State. Our trades
men are familiar with the need, of mining communities, and have all the experience
required for the proper management of the business. It will be our own fault, there
fore, if San Francisco is not made the central depot of Alaskan and British Colum
ban supplies. The first need will be the shipping required to carry on the trade.
That need should be provided speedily. Spread the sails at once and let our trade go
forward.
VALLEY EOAD PROGRESS.
Without much ado being made over the
fact, the Valley road has been steadily
extending its line and adding new cities
and towns to the list ot its beneficiaries.
During the year which ended June 30,
1897, 121.82 miles of track were laid, as
against 88.3 miles for the year previous
The company, as shown by the reports
of its engineers, has built more than 3000
feet of bridging, including several large
and handsome structures across the vari
ous rivers it was necessary to span. In
the year which ended the 30th of last
month two roundhouses and eight
depots were erected and many freight
platforms and stock' corrals constructed.
In addition, 116 miles of telegraph line
were built in connection with tho Postal
Telegraph Company.
The San Joaquin Valley Railroad, which
in its extreme infancy was alluded to by
its opponents as a ""toy"" affair, bas proved
an immense business proposition, and
thousands of farmers and stock-raisers in
the interioi of the State have bad reason
to feel grateful for its advent. During the
last twelvemonth the new line has added
to its equipments, among otber things,
four freight locomotives, three passenger
locomotives, ICO boxcars, 100 stockcars,
nine passenger coaches and three combi
nation baggage and passenger coaches
The total equipment of the road is now as
follows: Seven freight locomotives of 65
tons each, three passenger locomotives,
250 flatcars, 100 boxcars, 100 stockcars,
nine passenger coaches and three combi
nation baggage and passenger coaches.
Nobody terms it a ""toy"" affair any more.
It has grown to ba quite a giant in its
way, and is getting stronger and bigger
every hour.
The line is now being operated between
Stockton and a point beyond Hanford,
covering a distance of over 200 miles.
Reedley now enjoys communication
over the Valley road, and in less than a
month from this date Visalia will be
celebrating the entry of the line in that
city. If right-of-way difficulties could be
adjusted in time the road might possibly
be pushed on to Bakersfleld in time to
carry a portion of this year's Kern County
crops. Farmers of the San Joaquin Val
ley may well bless the new and popular
road for chopping down the high freight
tariffs and aiding the productive section
through which it passes to realize the
share of prosperity justly due.
UTAH'S SEMI-CEMENNIAL.
The celebration of the semi-centennial
of the pioneer settlement of Utah has at
tracted thousands of visitors to Salt Lake
City this week from all over the land. It
began Tuesday morning and will continue
until Saturday night. Among the first
day's ceremonies was the dedication of a
monument to Brigham Young and the
presentation to each of the pilgrims who
founded Utah fifty years ago of a gold
badge or medal struck in honor of
the occasion. Yesterday bjheld a splendid
pageant of progress, in which the Utah of
the past was contrasted with the Utah of
to-day.
Where the wilderness stretched away in
all directions from* the abodes of the ear
liest pioneers there are now prosperous
cities and towns and farms rich in yields
of wheat and corn. The mountains have
been exploited and made to give up their
treasures of precious metal. Numerous
otber industries have been built up here j
and there in that commonwealth through
the energy and enterprise of the people, j
and tbe thrifty young State of Utah may I
well boast of its rapid advancement.
Fifty years have brought marvelous
changes there. Steeds of steel are now
flying over the plains, bearing multitudes
to Salt Lake City, where a half century
ago the hardy pioneers were urging their
ox-teams forward to what they deemed
the promised land. Where in that olden
day the Mormons prayed and sang in
tents or under the arching blue, they now
gather for religious services in immense
tabernacles. Religious discord is no
longer known. Polygamy has been ban
ished from the State, and Gentile and
Mormon in perfect harmony now sow and
reap and trade and plan and build to
gether.
Utah Is a fertile country, and while its
vast stores of mineral wealth have known
no appreciable diminution its vegetable
output is destined to enrich a population
many times greater than that which now
prospers on its soil.
The offer of $6 for an orange by a miner
on the Yukon shows the value which
fresh fruits have in districts where gold is
plentiful and scurvy is imminent. There
seems therefore to be a big market for
California products in the Alaskan coun
try, and it is to be hoped our merchants
will take advantage of it. .
The contrast between the conditions of
trade during the first summer of McKin
ley and the first summer of Cleveland are
too striking to escape the attention of
any one. Prices were falling four years
ago and now they are going up.
According to Dingley talk on the tariff
costs the country about $100,000 a day.
Speaker Reed was therefore right in cut
ting it short.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 22, 1897.
WHEAT IS KING AGAIN.
The American farmer is once more
happy. Hard times with him are only a
memory of days gone by. This season
strikes him just right, for the big crops
have come alongside of the big prices,
ana King Wheat is on his throne again.
' There is a shortage in the wheat-pro
ducing countries of South America; India
is in the same condition, and also from
the nations of Europe comes the story of
light crops. The Australian harvest will
not begin until January next and the
yield there will be comparatively small.
The farmers of this country are obtaining
high figures for their grain to-day, and
the prospects are that the top-notch price
for wheat is yet to be reached. California
will be in the market with her wheat
earlier than any other part of the country,
and she will have a decided advantage
next year in meeting the strong demands
from lands where crops have been defi
cient.
Business in cash wheat for export is
! heavy in New York. On Tuesday, for in
! stance, 1,500,000 bushels were sold to for-
I eign buyers for shipment. In one demand
j for export it was represented that the
j wheat was to be shipped to Mediterranean
and Adriatic ports to which no wheat
from this country has gone except for
! seed since 1880. Among these ports are
| those of Triest and Venice, which are
■ usually supplied by Russia.
The world in fact depends upon the
A merican farmer very largely for its
breadstuffs this year, and there is every
i indication that the California wheat
■ growers will have another golden harvest
jto reap in 1898. The miners in the frozen
j north are not the only people who find
'things coming steadily their way ; there
i are others in luck, and prominent among
these others is to be found the American
wheat farmer.
THE STRUGGLE IN CUBA.
The end of Spanish rule in Cuba seems
to be near at hand. That bankrupt mon
archy cannot sustain the vain and costly
war much longer on the strength of senti
ment or on promises to pay based on a
ruined credit.
As evidence of the financial distress of
the Spanish Government dispatches from
Havana show that $40,000,000 is due to the
regular army and $18,000,000 to the navy.
Not only is money lacking to pay the sol
diers, but also for buying provisions and
clothing. While the Spanish troops may
obtain food by force, it will be very diffi
cult for them to get clothes. Even now
they are said to present pitiable specta
cles, as they are actually clad in rags and
resemble an army of tramps. They beg
money in the streets of Havana and enter
houses asking for bread. Theft is com
mon among them, and there are instances
where misery had driven them to deeds
of murder.
Spanish merchants own the groceries,
bakeries and meatshops of Havana, and
they are the first victims of the poverty of
the army. Being forced to contribute food
to the soldiers ruin stares the merchants
in the face, and they are closing up busi
ness and emigrating to Spain.
The only newspaper in Cuba which sup
ported autonomy is a miserable failure.
General Weyler appears to think that
Spanish troops can fight without salaries
as well as the Cubans. It is just possible,
however, that this man, who thought to
kill off the rebellion by wholesale butch
eries of men, women and children, will
wake up one of these' days to find his
army in general revolt Heavy desertions
have already been reported, and many a
young man who sailed from Spain to help
stamp out the ""insurrection"" 11 now
fighting in the Cuban ranks for Cuban
liberty and independence. The unseen
hand of heaven is dealing mighty strokes
in aid of the people who have sworn to
rend forever the chains of Spanish
tyranny. The Cubans cannot fail in the
war;, it is only a matter of months, and
probably only weeks, when victory will
perch upon their banners.
JEAN INGELOW.
Jean Ingelow has written so little of
later yeats that her work in literature was
virtually ended, and English letters have
probably suffered no loss by her deatb.
Nevertheless the passing away of a woman
whose writing, both in prose and verse,
has added so much to the joy of all who
delight in ""noble thoughts wedded to
noble words"" will be felt as a Joss through
out the English-speaking world. Another
soul of genius has passed from the earth
and we are deprived of one more of those
women who in the present generation
have helped to purify the morals of the
race by elevating the taste and leading it
to find pleasure in ideals of beauty and of
worth.
With the exception of Elizabeth Barrett
Browning Jean Ingelow was the foremost
singer among the women of her day. It
is doubtful if anything which she wrote
will be immortal/ for she lacked that
highest gift of genius, the power of creat
ing out of airy nothings forms which live
forever; but, nevertheless, she has con
tributed much to English literature which
will be long remembered and will be
cherished in ;■ many a homo and heart so
long as any of the men and women of her
own generation remain on earth.
While chiefly noted as a poet, and while
her fame will rest mainly on her poetical
works, Miss Ingelow in the later years of
her life showed herself to be possessed of a
fine talent as a novelist. Her . stories,
while they lacked artistic finish and
dramatic intensity, were always interest
ing. Her descriptions of English. home
life and the better and finer class of Eng
lish men and women were among the
most charming that havo ever been writ
ten. In fact so great is the degree of ex
cellence she attained in character sketch
ing it is probable if she had undertaken
the work of novel-writing earlier in life
and devoted her whole energies to it she
would have attained a rank in prose as
near to that of George Eliot as she at
tained in poetry to that of Mrs. Barrett
Browning.

THE FORGOTTEN EPISTLE.
I found lt again— an old letter,
'Twai written Ion?, long years ago,
In my younger days, when
The heart guttled the pen.
Nor waited on reason so slow.
And each line seemed a magical fetter
That linked me anew to the past.
She was there, a* of yore,
But we breathed them no mure
Vows too sweet and 100 fragile to last
Yet her voice with Is music came ringing
Again in my wondering ears,
And in radiance there
Shone the glint of h hair
A luster undlmmed by the years,
And my brain of asinKt-n seemed swinging
And my cheek seemed to light into flame
As I gazed at the place
Where I'd lingered to trace
""Yours Forever,"" and then signed my name.
There la no one to care for my sighing
As I look on the paper so worn.
And 1 try to be cold
And seem careless and bold,
Yet i thud.:er and think of her scorn.
For the writing is mine past denying,
And id my mind's eye 1 can bee
How the jury will grin
When the lawyers begin
On that letter marked "" Kxhlbtt B ""
— Washington star.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
A Berlin paper is publishing some unedited
letters iof celebrated German musicians-
Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, Wagner, etc. One of
the most curious is this, which the future
author of ""Parsifal."" then simply kapellmeister
to the King of Saxony, addressed to the di
rector of tie Grand Ducal Theater of Hesse-
Darmstadt, offering him his flrst great dra
matic work, ""Rlenz."": ""To the High Director
of the Grand Ducal Theater of the Court: I
permit myself to send the inclosed copy of
the score of my opera 'Rienzi,' with the urgent
prayer that he will let me know, at the very
latest In four weeks, whether my opera is ac
cepted by the director of the Grand Ducal
Theater of Darmstadt. My conditions are

modest in his demands at that time. Twenty

was able to supply himself with the sumptu
ous dressing-gowns that he affected and the
stuffs of silk, of velvet and of brocade with
which he wished to cover himself and his sur
roundings.
The Italian papers, copied by several French
journals, have bean making quite a noise over
the disappearance of the Greek composer
Splro Samara, author of ""Flora Mlrabills la
Martire,"" and several other operas, who they
say set out to take part in the Greco-
Turkish war and whom they supposed to be
dead, or at least wounded and a prisoner. A
Milanese paper takes the affair less tragically
and even pushes skepticism to the borders of
raillery. ""If we can believe,"" it says, ""the
confidences of a friend, Samara has been for
some time bidden under the Theater Lyrique
of Milan; and while waiting for the resurrec
tion of his 'Furia Domata' he may mysteri
ously put to music an elegy over the fall of
Domoko, with a march in fugue style upon the
heroic retreat of Prince Constantine.""
At Paris the Opera Comique has closed its
door— the annual closing— with an excellent
representation of ""Werther,"" which had at
tracted to the theater all the admirers of this
very admirable score of so exquisite a color
and sentiment. M. Carvalho, however, is not
therefore free from the cares of his position.
Every day he hears unpublished scores. First
it was ""Le Caprice de Koi,"" by M. Paul Puget,
which is announced' for representation next
winter; then the ""Spabl,"" by M. Lucien Lam
bert, which will also be on an early pro
gramme; afterward the ""Louise"" of M. Gus
taveCharpentier. M. (.'at ho does not only
hear scores; he also hears the artists, and
among them he sometimes meets with some
excellent ones, as Mile. Suzanne Adams, who
passed the opera with success, and will make
her debut at the Opera Comique next October.
The French papers are congratulating Mme.
Nordics on having made her peace with M.
Jean de Reszke. The Menestrel adds : ""This
little war has just terminated by a telegram
which Mme. Nordica has addressed to a large
New York journal, confessing that she had
been misinformed, and that it was not M. de
Reszke who had prevented her engagement by
M. Grau during the last New York season. In
any case Mme. Nordica has gained for herself
a very pretty little advertisement, which, by
her ordinary means, of which we have been
able to judge lately in Paris, would probably
not otherwise have been assured to her.""

Mme. Frances Saville was to have sung the
partof 'he Forest Bird in Siegfried with the
Coven t Garden Opera Company, but she noti
fied the management that she did not consider
the role suitable and that they had better have
a substitute ready. When Conductor Seidl was
informed of this, he refused to rehearse the
piece with Madame Saville, and some one else
sang the part. It appears, however, that she
eventually took the role and greatly distin
guished herself.
MM. Camllle 8 int-Saens and Louis Gallet,

The Municipal Council of Milan has decided
to give this year no subsidy to the Scala Thea

similar to which it would he very desirable to

A strange newspaper, which many persons
will be eager to obtain, had its existence dis
closed ior the first time at the Yon Tausch
libel trial in Berlin. It seems that certain
aristocrats as Kaiser Wiihelm's court turn in
the gossip they hear to an editor who prints
off a limited edition of the news thus collected
from the contributors and a very few other
persons. To get at this chronique scandaleuse
a member of the secret police forged, with full
acquiescence from his superiors, the name of a
nobleman high in court circles.

DEMOCRATS AGAINST BRYANISM
_ St Louis Globe-Democrat. -■-■'■
The purpose of the gold Democrats to con
tinue their organization Is a fact of great pol
itical significance. „ It means that the breach
in the Democracy is not going to be narrowed
while the silver issue remains. The only way
of course, that this element, or any other poll
Uical iacUoi* or party, could maintain itself
as an organization Is by nominating candf...
dates in every canvass in its locality and hy
supporting those candidates vigorously at the'
potis. lowa has already put up a gold Dem
ocratic ticket to be V""ted for in November.
Kentucky is about to take similar action,:
while Ohio, it it understood, will move in the
same direction. Reports have been beard of
a similar purpose in other States which have
elections this year. ' '■ •*"" ' •
It is easy to grasp the Importance of this
purpose of the Clevelands, the Carlisles and ,
the other gold Democratic leaders to continue
the fight against the conspirators who wrecked
their party and wno attempted to wreck the
country. The estimate that the gold Demo
crats cast 1,000,000 votes in 1896 seems rea
sonable. Palmer received 133,000 of these,
and the rest of them «ere givon to McKinley.
To be sure these 1,000,000 votes represent less
than a quarter of the Democratic strength of :
the couutry after doducting the Populist vote,
which wint to Bryan last year, but which will
not be cast again for any ticket, tilverite or
other, bearing the Democratic label. Ihe gold
element's power, however, is greater than its
numerical strength would indicate. It com-
J irises the wealta, brains and character ol the -',
Democracy. So long as that element stays
apart from the regular organization the Dem
ocracy will be as powerless as it was in 1809
or 1872. That this element will be hostile to
the Bryan and Tillman branch of the party
three years hence, if last year's issues are up
again, is as certain as any event of the future -
uot governed by physical laws can be.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THE SUMMER MONTHS.
Are yon polng to the country on a vacation If
ro. It is no trouble lor us to forward THE CALF., to
j-our address. Do not let It miss you for you will
inlss it. Orders given to the carrier or left at
Business Office will receive prompt attention. |
KO KXTKA CHARGE. i'ii:y cents per mouth :
for summer month*- -
Hail the new tariff.
Confidence is restored.
The next thing will ba the currency
question.
Congress has done its work better than
ever before in this generation.
For the promptness of the work done at
Washington, thanks are due to Speaker
Reed.
Now if the coal-miners' strike can De
settled on fair terms, everything will be
iovely.
The Democrats of the Senate had sense
enough not to monkey with the buzz-saw
this time.
The country will tafee note that the Re
publican parfy is redeeming its pledges in
record-breaking time.
Thi? is the day for Klondyke enthu
siasts to take a sober second thought and
count tue cost of the trip going and re
turning.
A Chicago man is under arrest on a
charge of stealing a two-story house and
carrying it a mile, and once more the St.
Louis boomers arc Dale with envy.
It maybe d'fhcult for the European
concert to pet the Turks out of Thessaly,
but it will ba more difficult «till for them
to get the indomnit"" out of Greece.
It is said that Osden Goelet told a ""close
friend"" that he would rather see his
daughter in her grava than married to the
Duke of Manchester, but it has never been
explained how the story got out if the
friend was close.
Unless things settled down this winter
and the cold weather takes the heat out of
the gold excitement the rush of Eastern
people for Alaska n?xt spring will make
San Franci co livelier than the Christian
Endeavor Convention.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch runs a
column of letters from the people contain
ing suggestions a3 to ""now to make St.
Louis great and beautiful,"" and it is an
evidence of the wisdom of the people that
one of th m says ""You can't make St.
Louis great and beautiful without abolish
ing it.""
Even in these days of problems of the
unemployed it is said that in some parts
of the Mississippi Valley wheat croDS are
going to ruin because farmers cannot find
men to work in the harvest fields. It la
not always that the worker and the work
who need one another are found in the
same district.
A company of the Missouri National
Guard which was sent out to go through
some maneuvers on bicycles returned to
camp in a cart, and it is said the com
manding officer will recommend to the
War Department that in case of war each
squad of cyclers should do accompanied
by an ambulance.
Senator Mason of Illinois is reported to
have been paid $500 for delivering a Fourth
o July oration, and while the price is none
too high for a good thing of the kind, a
United states Senator should hnva been
patriotic enough to contribute his voice
to the celebration of the day without
charging prima donna rates.
At the teachers' convention in Mil
waukee, one of the speakers declared the
speech of another to be ""demagogic bun
come fit for consumption only in a fools'
paradise."" It is only just to Milwaukee
and to the teachers from ocber parts of
the L'nion to add that both speakers were
from Chicago, and had acquired the
Alderman style of debate at home.
The senior class of a young ladies' semi
nary In New Haven distinguished itself
th.s year by the fact that eacii member of
it made her graduating gown with her
own hands and in no case did the material
cost more th&n $■"">. It is safe to say the
career that class looks forward to is the
old-fashioned one of matrimony, and the
eirls knew how to advertise the fact.
According to Colorado estimates, that
State will produce this year $24,000,000
worth of gold, $15,000,000 wortli of silver.
$3,000,000 worth of lead and $1,500,000
worth of copper. The estimates may be
somewhat high, but there is no doubt the
mining interests of the State are advancing
rapidly, and the output in the aggregate
will surpass that of any previous year.
The latest Newport novelty is to be a
garter show arranged by a number of the
smart sec who are tired of the old things.
£ach woman in the plot is expected to
furnish one of her own garters. The lot
will be numbered and tne men who Day to
see the exhibits may vote for that which
they most admire. It any woman is so
unfortunate as to have her garter iden
tified she forfeits $50. The garter receiv
ing the highest number of votes is to bo
sold for ""sweet charity,"" and the pur
chaser will be required to wear it at the
next Casino hop. It is expected the turn
raited for charity by the show will amount
to auite a legacy.
NOW FOR THE ERA OF PROSPERITY.
Tne most urgent work which devolved upon the present Congress of the United
i States has been completed, and the ""Wilson tariff now gives place to a protective
measure destined to yield the greatest good to the greatest number throughout the
country.
It cannot be expected that the benefits of the Dingley law will be fully apparent
from the moment of its passage. As soon as normal conditions arc reached in rela
tion to supply and demand of dutiable goods, however, we shall begin to experience
the beneficial effects of the new bill. For the first few months there will necessarily
be a falling off in revenues on account of the recent importation of an enormous
, amount of goods upon which a higher tariff has been placed. As soon as the surplus
| stock in the market 13 consumed we shall begin to reap the reward of the people's
wise action in November last.
It need hardly b9 pointed out that the mo<t important outcome of this legislation
will be the activity in trade which must result from the settlement for some years to
come, at least, of tariff uncertainty. Ali important industrial interests have been
furnished adequate protection, and those who wera leading advocates of the bill in
Senate and House are certain that it will provide sufficient revenue for the demands
of the Government.
California has reason to rejoice over the blessings conferred upon her by the new
law. In no previous tariff enactment have her interests been so fully and favorably
considered. She demanded protection for nor great wine interests, and the result is
a dry-wine tariff of 40 cents a gallon. She demanded a duty on citrus fruits and
Zante currants, and Congress gave her just what she ask9d for. Her prune industry
and her raisin industry will likewise be encouraged and rendered more profitable by
the appreciable degree of protection accorded them. Her beet-sugar lactories and
sugar-beet farmers will share in the general benefits. Her groves of walnuts and
almonds and olives will become more valuable property as a result of the new duties
011 those products.
The Dingiey law will aid every great interest in the Golden State. The agricul
turist, the horticulturist, the wine-grower, the manufacturer, will all Drofit by its
provision?, and our commerce, in common with that of the whole country, will be
advanced.
The Republican party has more than ever earned the praise of the Nation at
large. In less than five months from the day of President McKinley's inauguration
it has wiped out the obnoxious free-trade Wilson bill, and has fulfilled its pledge to
give the United States a substantial protective law. The tar ff question having now
been settled, the party of American principles and American idef.s may be depended
on to pursue, with speed, firmness, vigor and wisdom, the work of remedying such
other ills as may exist in the affairs of our Government. The Nation is in safe, com
petent, tried and loyal hands. The ship of state has been rescued from the reefs of a
ruinous policy, and is once again headed, with colors flying and glorious sails out
spread, toward the open sea of prosperity.
THE NEW BONANZA.
The stimulating reports reaching us
from the Klondyke mines are but nursery
tales compared with those which routed
the sturdy pioneers of California woo left
home at a period in our history when it
was an undertaking of great magnitude to
reach this coast. The argonauts of '4'J
came to California and dug gold out of
every creek, bank, bar, ravine and river
bed from Oregon to Mariposa, and from
the Coast Ranee to the Sierra Nevadas.
Here they found a climate that offered
them the possibility to work 565 days in
each year, easy of access, entirely free
Irom climatic severities, supplemented by
that greatest of God's blessings, another
home under the American fl;>g.
There was no extensive journalism at
that time to publish the exploits of for
tunate individuals or boom tne unknown
richness of any restricted locality. Each
different district in those days advertised
itself by the daily procession returning
from the mines with their well-filled sacks
and belts en route to their ""home in the
States,"" and there was plenty left lor
those who would take the trouble to go
and dig it oat.
Yet, that was only the dim twilight of
California's prosperity. The permanent,
self-sustaining, greater California came
after the ""Arabian Nights"" feature had
ceased to be an attraction.
The large emigration from California
and Canada to the sterile lands and the
inhospitable climate of the Arctic during
the Cariboo and Fraser River excite
ments have entered into the legendary
lore of the pa-.t, leaving no permanent
monuments behind dedicated to success,
progress and civilizatiou.
The moose and the cariboo are to-day
silently following the trails and cross
roads marked out by those venturesome
spirits, or possibly taking shelter under
the ruins of their once populous villages.
An occasional headstone doubtless re
mains to record the sorrowful fact that
near that onceeventful spot youth, energy
and ambition reluctantly became weary
and gave up its tiresome searcn for gold.
That large quantities of yellow metal
have lately arrived from the Klondyke
placers is unquestionably true, but tue
possibility that the rich deposits are not
confined to a small and already occupied
locality must remain undetermined until
the commencement of another prospect
ing season in April or May next.
Let us confidently hope that the pros
pects of next year will develop new and
larger fields containing enough gold for
all who are now going and those who may
hereafter follow. Shonld it prove other
wise the future outlook would be alarm
ing. While we are compelled to patiently
wait for a period of eight or nine months
it seems to be more economical and cer
tainly safer to remain in California during
that period than rush away to a country
where one must necessarily be confronted
with enforced idleness and confinement
while the thermometer ranges from 30 to
60 degrees below zero.
MAP OP THE GOLD FIELDS.
The Call presents this morning the
tirst complete and reliable map of the in
terior gold region of Alaska that has been
published anywhere.
It has been compiled and drawn for The
Call by .Professor George Davidson, than
wuom no higher authority could ba ap
pealed to. Professor Davidson was for
over a generation the head and director
of the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey on this coast, and his own astro
nomical and geodetic work has at various
times taken him into the snowy Alaskan
ranges. The Government boundary sur
veys have been under his immediate direc
tion, and besides his intimate personal
acquaintance with the subject he com
mands a mass of charts, reports and other
information inaccessible to most people.
Professor Davidson 's map represents a
large amoui.-t of care and labor, and is
intelligently prepared. It admits of no
comnar.son with the hastily thrown to
gether outline sketches, full of absurd
inaccuracies, which flock to the public
vision as maps of Alaska. It is by a mas
ter geographer, and is a loni? advance on
the best that have gone before. Tbe latest
and best of its rivals are bare of the names
and geographical features that ara now
of universal interest. These are shown
accurately and readily, and the overland
route from Juneau to the gold fields is
shown in correct detail.
T'Je map is accompanied by information
which will help mafce it by far the most
complete and reliable exposition of the
country thac it is possible to obtain. It
will provide an invaluable char* to those
making the journey, and will enable read
ers of Alaskan events to acquire under
standing of the localities which are now
the centers of public interest.
In her eagerness to take ttie lead in the
development of our social ways and cus
toms, St. Louis is about to take a step
which will not catch on in this part ol the
country. Some of her undertakers propose
to organize a corps of professional pall
bearers.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 25, 1897.
SPEAKER REED.
The hero of the season not in Washing
ton only but throughout the country it
Speaker Reed. He has been the most
conspicuous figure of the extra session in
Congress. Not even the newly elected Pres
ident, so justly popular with the masses,
stands higher to-day in the esteem of the
people. The main success of the adminis
tration thus far has been due to him. It
was the President who called the extra
session and who recommended the adop
tion of a revenue-producing tariff, but it
was the Speaker who directed the combat
and achieved the victory.
The new tariff is a McKinley measure.
It is the Dingley bill. Allison and Aid
rich have done great service in revising it
and procuring its passage through the
Senate. Nevertheless its enactment is the
victory of the Speaker more than any one
else. This is everywhere recognized by
friend and foe alike. The cartoons of the
comic weeklies picture Speaker Heed
more often than any one else, and the
papers of the creat cities direct their praisa
or blame toward him more than toward
any other man.
The triumph of the Speaker has been
achieved by a strict attention to the duties
of his office, and by a masterful control of
a stormy legislative body. He has iheld
the unruly elements in check and enabled
the House to do business. Democrats and
Populists have been prevented from
delaying the work of the majority and im
peding the performance of the task in
trusted to it by the people. Without this
strong and wisely directed control Con
gress would have been wrangling and de
bating to this day and the business of the
country would still be uncertain of the
outcome.
It is gratifying that the commendation
I iriven to the Speaker comes not altogether
! from Republican sources. Business men
, of ail pariies unite in expressing their ap
preciation of the work performed by him
' in hastening the passage of the tariff bill
; and putting au end to the uncertainty
which harasses industry. This commen
dation is the more valuable because it
j atones in some respect for the abuse, mi
i vective and denunciation with which he
was assailed wben during his first speak
ership he undertook to make tne House a
legislative body instead of a wrangling
and tumultuous debating society. It
com?s late, but not too late, and aoes jus
| tice at last to one who for a long time has
j been the most grossly misrepresented of
| our public men.
The grateful recognition which has been
everywhere given to the work of Speaker
Reed is significant of the value which the
American people place upon the service of
a statesman who serves by deeds even more
than by words. There has been no event
of the session out of which he has made
an opportunity for personal display. He
has had no part in the tariff debate. He
has had no occasion to show his firmness
and parliamentary skill in ruling a noisy
revolt as in former session*. What he has
done has been accomplished without
stress or strain, and it is the silent record
of work achieved which wins for him the
honor of the American people.
AS VIEWED BY A TfiENOHMAN.
M. Kmile Levasseur of the National In
stitute of Francfc has recently contributed
an article to the press on American work
men, the wages they receive, the machin
ery they operate and their standard of
living. While he found treat differences
in the earnings of wapeworkers in the
various sections of this country, neverthe
less, on the whole it was demonstrated
that the American wage rate is exceed
ingly high as compared with that of
France, or even of England, where wages
are higher than those of any other
European country.
The writer disputes the doctrine that the
increase cf 50 per cent in wages during: the
last thirty years is due wholly to the pres
sure which trades unions have been able
to bring to bear on employers by means of
strikes, and directs attention to the fact
that the wages of agricultural laborers,
who are not organizod, have increased
nearly in the same proportion as those of
most of the workers in oiher industries,
r, hile the wages of domestic servants, both
in this country and in France, have risen
more in proportion than those of the or
ganized workers. Notwithstanding all
this M. Levasseur does not deny that
trades unions have influence. He asserts
that they are very strong in numbers and
have taken an active part in the efforts of
workers to secure shorter hours, higher
wages and better conditions in general for
the laboring man.
The marvelous development of machin
ery in America ia treated of by M. Levas
seur, who declares that progress in me
chanics has been more rapid in the United
States thao in any other country in the
world, ''because the Americana have a
genivis for invention combined with bold
ness in undertaking new enterprises ;. be
cause their population has increased trom
four millions a century ago to more than
seventy millions, while the wealth of the
country has increased faster than the
population, and because this great iium-
ber ol people furnishts an immense mar-
ket for all kinds of goods, a market in
which the per capita consumption is mucb
larcer than in European countries.""
The standard of living of the American
womer is higher than that of any other
country on earth. With the exception of
luxuries, it was found that the average
price of jroods consumed by the working
classes was very little higher in America
than in France, while provisions are
slightly fc>wer here. The one item of ex
pense whfch is nearly always heavier for
the workers of American than for
those of France is rent. But the Ameri
can laborer, however, requires far better
accommodations than the French laborer.
His home is larger, belter furnished and
more comfortable.
As to the causes of high wages, M. Le
vasseur opines that they depend on sev
eral, of which the principal is ""the total
amount of wealth previously existing or
produced at any given timo by labor and
ihe average quantity of wealth produced
by the individual worker.""
There is always a question as to the rate
in which the distribution of this wealth
shall be made as between capital, man
ager*, and labor, ""but the wages Can, in no
ca<e, under penalty of ruin for the indus
try, equal the total value of the product. 1 '
It is, therefore, concluded ""that the pro
ductivity of labor is one of the principal
causes which regulate wages."" And M.
Levasseur, had he looked further into the
matter, would have discovered that an
other leading cause of higher wages in this
country during the past thirty years is
the American protective policy, to which
is also due very largely wonderful
progres-< made by the mills and factories
of the United States.
LIMITS OF MILITARISM IN
FRANCE.
The rapid growth of the vast military ma
chines in the states of Continental Europe is
one ot the most marked features of the pres
ent century. First adopted by Prussia, after
her disastrous defeats at the lianas of Napo
leon, the general system of short service and
reserves has received such a development,
especially since the Franco-German war, that
these countries have become veritable camp
grounds. Still theory is for more soldiers and
greater expenditures for armaments.
With peace armies of over half amilllon men
each there is still no cud in sight. When there
are two rival nations of about equal power
any increase of force in the one army is sure
to be the signal for increasing the other also,
and the process is thus continuous. Id the
middle of the present century the annual mili
tary contingent of Franco was 80,000, while
It is now 240.000. As late as 1803 the entire
German contingent was 170,000, and now is
about the same as that of France. If to the
active army we add the reserves the resulting
force is of a size by the side of which the
famous hordes of antiquity seem small.
According to a well-informed writer In the
Revue dcs Deux Mondes, Italy, Russia, Aus
tria, France ana Germany have at present a
total trained lorce of nearly 17,000,000.
out of some 25,000,000 men oi military
age, and the remaining one-third have had
some military instruction. What will be the
final limit no one can at present foretell, but
it is only a question of time, evidently, when
the entire adult male population will havo
had military training. Before tnis happens
the financial burden may become absolutely
insupportable, or the people may finally en
ter an effectual protest against the system.
While we may deplore the system of uni
versal military service and consequent with
drawal of so many men from civil pursuits,
there are still mßny compensations, and the
European nations would not submit to the
burden unless there were some ever-present
necessity, or at least supposed necessity,
which amounts to the same thing, practically
speaking.
Until recently there has never been any
trouDle in filling the annual contingent of re
cruits, but in France the limit seems finally
to liave been reached and she cannot increase
the bizc of her active army, because the availa
ble population is not sufficient, even when
every man of proper age is drawn upon. With
a population of 38,000,000 she is keeping up
an army of the same s'.zo na Germany, while
the latter power has a population of 52.000,000
to draw upon. Thus in France the war
strength is 111 per thousand oi population as
against 82 in Germany, and a* low as4(iin
Austria. With a stationary or even decreasing
population France will have apparently to
give up the struggle for mere numbers oi
soldiers. According to the French Annual
Report of Army Recruiting ior 1895 there
were 337,000 youths of a suitable age to enter
the army that year. After deducting those
who failed to appear (some 9000), those phy
sically disqualified and those allowei to enter
for one year's service, there remained only
142,000 men entering the ranks for the regu
lar term of three years. The remainder of the
210,000 required were made up from the one
year's men and some 18,000 put back the pre
vious two years for some slight physicalim
maturity or infirmity.
The di-creasing population in France has
Deen the cause of serious alarm for some time
and has been the subject of innumerable arti
cles in the public prints. All this time Ger
many has been forging ahead, and in the past
seven years the German birth* have been
double those in France. According to the
eminent statistician, M. Ber'.illon, in thirteen
or fourteen years there will be two German
conscripts for every French one.
It Ectms hopeless for France to compete with
Germany under these circumstances; but, on
the other hand, if past and recent experience
in war teaches anything it is that mere num
bers do mi' always win by any means, and
herein lies the hope of France. As a recent
writer has put it, the French army may still
meet that of Germany on terms of equality
and hope to make a winning fmht, if lor mere
numbers she substitutes quality in her sol
diers.
This will probably bo effected by a return to
a greater or less extent to the system of long
service with the colors, with its corresponding
better training, and with the- result of putting
into the fi,-titimr line men of inaturer age and
those better fitted to bear the privations and
fatigues of active campaigning than the pres
ent youthful and half-trained contingents.
The outcome will be most interesting,
whatever it may be, and the failure of the
system in this instance may predispose the
nations concerned to agree to a reduction in
firmament. Although this has often been
proposed and strongly urged, so far there has
not been found any nation that is willing to
take the initiative in the matter, and the nat
ural distrust of nations so situated has proven
a great stumbling-block to the realization of
the plan. Now that It is proven, in at least
one instance, that the limit has been reached,
we may hope that it will have its effect in
gradually decreasing the contingent* of other
armies.
SPEAKER REED'S AVOIRDUPOIS.
Washington Post.
Although Speaker Reed is seriously con
cerned over the outcome of the tariff bill,
there is something which weighs even heavier
on his mind.
He is growing corpulent
Years ago Reed was a big man, broad-shoul
dered, heavy limbed, but be was well-propor
tioned. Then he began to grow stout. This
did not trouble him, because upon his large
frame the accumulating flesh was well dis
tributed. Now, nowever, he has reached the
point where his fatness is becoming annoying.
Nothing that he can do w 11 decrease the load
that ne seems donmud to carry. He exercises,
though notagreaicieal, be walks, even in this
hot weather, and he carefully avoids all fat-
Droducing foods.
Notwithstanding nil these precautions, the
inches are being added 10 Ins girth and his
weight continues to increase. Just where it
will end he does not know, although he would
like to do so. Not only is his bulk inconven
ient, but he has been compelled to discard
suits that fitted him well enough not so many
months ago. Last summer's clothes seem to
have shrank when he attempts to get into
them.
His increasing size attracted the attention
of a Congressman tne otherday, and he was
asked how uuch he weighed.
'•Two hundred pounds,"" promptly replied
the Speaker.
""Wny, Mr. Speaker,"" s dd (be Congressman,
honestly surprised. ""I weigh '200 pounds ray
self, and you surely are one-third heavier.""
""I don't care what you weigh'"" replied Mr.
Reed instantly, ""but no gentleman ever
weighs over 200 pounds.""
AN EMPEROR'S PORTABLE
HOUSE.
When Emperor William of Germany recently
journeyed to Heligoland to witness the finish
of the yacht race from Dover to Heligoland,
for which he had offered a magnificent cup, ft
very difficult problem arose, that of properly
housinsc his imperial Majesty. The official
buildings are too small and the Emperor did
not want to go to a hotel.
The Emperor himself found a way out oJ
this difficulty by remembering a portable
house he had purchased at the Berlin exposi
tion last year, which except for being a trifle

longer than the type of portable barracks
adopted by the German army, corresponds
exactly to those buildings. It was accordingly
shipped to Heligoland, and was erected there
Inside of a few hours in the garden of the
military commander's quarters.
Tne portable building is fifty-two feot long
by sixteen feet three inches wide, and in
cludes a parlor, a bedroom, a bathroom and a
small attendant's room, with an adjoining
entry. In front of the parlor there is a small
addition for another entry.
The floor of the house consists of twenty-one
flat boxes, within which the entire house and

its (\ >ii tents can l.c stored away, the roof and
side walls forming the covers of the boxes. A
system of hooks and catches anchors the
boxes together so as to form as solid a flooring

AT TWILIGHT.
Out of the dusk, wlml-biown and thin,
The shadowy wood boats gather In,
And twilitilit Miiiln's the harbor's din—
Jbleop, little ht-ad, on my shoulder!
The gold Hants vrnke through the evening gray
In the little village beside the bay,
And a few cold stars g earn 'ar away—
bleep, lltue head, on my shoulder!
The sailor turns his face once more
Where his sweetheart waits at the opened door;
The lone light washes the wave-swept shore -
bleep, little head, on my shoulder!
Here where the dancing shadows swarm
Our iiiifi wood tire is bright and warm;
Beyond our window urkps the germ —
I hen sleep, little head, on my shoulder!

THE MINERS REMEMBERED.
Seattle Post-Intellicencer.
""Do you see those nuggets?"" With the fore
going remark Tom Cochran of ihiscity handed
a Post-Intellig'-ncer reporter a small jar al
most full of yellow chunks. ""Well, that is
gold from the Klondyke, and It typefies the
proverbial generosity. That gold is a present
to me because I sent a few copies of the Post-
Inielltgencer into Alaska last season. You see,
my friends Dick Butler aud Charley Meyers
riad been prospecting in that country, and one
day I bundled up the papers and dropped
them in the mail. Plncj the Portland got in I
have received this borne of gold. Butler and
Meyers, through htu-ing those papers, had tho
only library in the Kiondyke. and the miners
conpregated from all the creeks and read
everything in those papers, advertisements
and all. One day a crowd was in the cabin,
and Butler said:
'• 'Boys, I don't mind your reading he pa
pers, but 1 think you ought to remember the
fellow who sent them. I'm going to put up k
little contribution box, 1 and he left the bottle
near the papers.""
The miners did not forget, and to-day Mr
Cochran has the dust. It is worth $400.
NATURAL DESTINY OF CANADA.
Not a Dependency of a Foreign State,
but Part of the Republic.
From a Speech by Goldwln Smith at itoorefleld.
""Why should you be spending your earnings
in military lines of steamships, or military
preparations of any kind? Do you want to
fight the million of Canadians over the way,
many of them your own sons or brothers ? Is
it wise to spend your money on unprofitable
lines of road, only that you may not use Amer
ican roads, while the Americans are freely
using yours?
""Look at the map. Not the delusive map
which makes Canada a Rolid muss of territory
extending to the north pole, but the truthful
map, which shows the geographical distribu
tion and relations of our ;>everal provinces.
You will theu see what the construction oi
lines of trnfhc In Canada, entirely separate
from the rest of the continent, means. To
keep 5.000,000 of North Americans out of
North America will be a difficult and costly
undertaking. To the few ihe experiment may
bear fruit in peerapei or knighthood; 10 the
ninny it will bear fruit in incr»ase of taxation.
""There are people who, from social fancy as
well as for political objec.s. wan t to buildup
a barrier of hatred lie 1 ween us and our kins
men to the south, while England, to whom we
■re all so loyal, is courting American friend
ship by all the means in her power.
""There does unfortunately exist feeling
against Great Britain in the United States.
That feeling is likely to continue, and when
any friction arises to show itself so long as
Great Britain remains a political or military
power on this continent. You would have the
tame thing on the otner side if the United
States were a political and military power on
the flank of England. But fßamst"" Canada as
an American community there is no feeling
whatever.""

To a question put to Justin McCarthy by tho

ereign who ever ruled over the British empire.
If that does not make an epoch I know of
nothing that rossibly could.""

HEAT CURLED UP THE RAILS.
Kansas City Journal.
Santa Fe trainmen vouch lor the statement
that Friday's through California train was
flagged by section men two miles this side of
Lexington because the rails of the track had
been curved by the heat into the appearance
of sleigh-runners, the heavy iplkes having
been pulled from the oak ties and thrown into
the air by the Btrain of tne bendiojf rails.
The accident occurred but a few minutes
before the train was due to pass, and had not
! the section men been at once attrected to the
I spot by the noise of the flying spikes the train
| would nave dashed into the break and have
: been hurled from the track.
Passengers on th..> train stated that the he»t
! at the point of the accident was terrific.
; While the repair of the track was going on the
| occupants of the train sought a wood at one
i side of the track and remained there until the
| work was completed. Ii was two hours before
j the track was la shape for the train to pro
ceed.

TOM REED ON McMILLIN.
Washlngto i Post.
Congressmen Benton McMlllin and James
D. Richardson are candidates for the Sena
torial appointment to succeed the late laham
G. Harris of Tennessee, and there is much
speculation in Washington relative to the re*
suit. McMiUtn has served five terms In Con
gress and is 52 years old, the right age for a
Senator. Tom Reed, Speaker, cannot stand
McMillin. Richardson is one of his pet aver
sions, but he can manage to get along with
him. He would like to see McMillin dis
patched to the Senate end of the Capitol, for
the Tennesseean is worse than a nngging old
woman with ihirty children. ""Richardson
talks a good deal,"" Mr. Reed said on a certain
occasion, ""but he is a good-natured fellow,
and what he says doesn't moke the least d if
feience one way or the other. McMiliin i* dif

The popular .subject of the gold of the
Kiondyke was discussed 1 at the meeting
of .the Columbian branch of the Socialist
Labor party last evening, but. not in the
feverish manner in which it is talked of in
other places. -.It was discussed from an
economic standpoint, and finally the ver
dict.was that the discovery is. not in the
long fan so much of a benefit, as it is or
will.be a curse. The speaker was George
Cumnring, the manufacturer, and his sub
ject wa;?, ""What benefit will result to so
ciety from the discovery of gold on the
Kiondyke ?"". -Jir.C.u mining is well known
in this City, having been prominently be
fore the people in a number of progressive
and reform ' movement?. , The chairman,
R.T. ;Mclvor, introduced him as one who
is not yet a socialist, 1 but who has done
much good in aiding in the cause of
humanity,-.
• Mr. . dimming began by saying that
there are two ways of looking at the sub
ject. : One is that the discovery will add
greatly to the circulating medium of the
world;, furnish employment for a large
number of idle men and cause business to
boom. The other is from the standpoint
of the economist—what effect will the dis
covery have uoon society? Before answer
ing, bis own question the speaker re
viewed the situation in mi. State, and
cal lea particular attention to the fact that
here we have everything that the human
family could wish. Yet for all that men
are compelled to tramp the streets in idle
ness, while their children suffer for the
common necessaries of life and the women
go in rags. At the same time the State
could support many thousands of more
people.
Then he spoke of gold as a medium of
.exchange, and said tnat men have raised
this metal to the position of a god. This
excitement simply means that thousands
of men are rushing off to the new fields for
the purpose of digging more of the same
god out 'of holes in the frozen- ground in
order that they may do some more wor
shiping. .•'.''
• In regard to the effect on the country,
Sir. Cumming stated, that the discovery
will be of ho benefit whatever. - He said
that a. great gold mine was never a benefit
to a Gauntry. He cited Spain, which in
.her: palmy days had the wealth of the
world poured into her lap, but where is
she no* ? Mexico and Peru, also rich in
the wealth of precious metals, are
Countries to be pitied, for their people are
the! most degraded in the world.
. .H a '-quoted, a Mexican saying that ""a
rich '• ed'id.. • mine never benefited a
country,!' Marty an ancient country, he
stated, owed its downfall to its wealth,
Which always Hows into the coffers of a
la*vo?e'd ""tew.'- while . the 'masses became
.'slaves. Mr.. Cumming made no exception
Of California. He- said that it was not
her gold that made ""this State great, but
.the other natural' advantages of climate,
soil, its situation for commercial purposes
and the opportunities for men to labor to
advantage. ""• It is true the gold mines first
attracted the attention of the world to the
' State^ but -other features made the .State
great. He declared that the mines now
aie ho benefit to California..
The hv-draulic apparatus have torn up
' beautiful. and productive valleys and
brought: fuin'to hundreds of farmers and
or.chardi_.ts by the overflow of debris
: . washed from the hills and valleys. ""In
other words,"" said he, ""we have torn our
beautiful Slate into barren gulches and
frightful boles in order to get out a little
gold, for what purpose — to pour into the
pockets, of the Rothschilds in Europe,
leaving us the holes.""
'. Mr; Cumming contended that this rush
for gold is but the gambling lever— de
sire: to become, rich all at once and with
out the long labor that alone should go
with wealth. Hi* remedy for all of these
evils is the substitution of paper money
as a representative of labor and the aboli
tion of the precious metals as a medium
of exchange. He advocated the use of
notes simply to represent labor, tbe true
wealth of-evey country. Mh___

. SOCIALISM WILL COME.
Views of Tom Beresford, the Author
■'""■ -of Several Political Works.
'• Washington Hall, on Eddy street, was
filled last evening, it being the regular
gathering, of the American Branch. The
speaker of the evening was Tom Beresford,
the author of a clever book, ""The Philos
ophy of Wage Slavery."" His subject was
""Inevitability of Socialism."" His reasons
for believing that Socialism will prevail Is
because things are working that way.
He said that the middle classes are be
ing crushed down into the wo.'kmg
classes. They then will have the same
economic interest and, ■ therefore, the
same political Views as the working class
and will unite in* order to right the com
mon enemy. He pointed out that this
industrial evolution was working precisely
as Carl Marx and Herbert Spencer had
predicted.
Mr. Beresford described some of the hor
rors of the great French Revolution, and
he said, ""Some people think that social
ists are trying to bring about a violent
revolution similar to it, but such is not
the case.
""The very reverse is true; we are run
ning a race with the train of events that
produce violent revolutions. Like cause
produce like effects, and the same causes
that produced the terrible French revolu
tion are at work in .this country. Social
ism can and will be won by the ballot.
Even if violence were successful political
methods would have to be used afterward
in any case.""
May Bo a Sort of Double-X Ray.
A remarkable discovery has just been
made by FranK L. Woodward of this city,
in the rinding of a new ray of light, closely
resembling the Roentgen in its properties,
but produced under entirely different con
ditions. The rays are obtained directly
from decomposed light, and Mr Wood
ward has named them Spectropic X rays.
They have great penetrative power, and
with them radiographs of the hand and
other non-transparent bodies have been
obtained.
Like the Roentgen ray, the Spectropic
X ray eludes the. spectroscope, and is
believed of very short vibrative period.
.The discovery of the Woodward rays
will throw important light upon the
nature of Roentgen rays, and prove
beyond douDt that the Roentgen rays are
waves of very short vibrative period.
The details of the method of production
of the Woodward rays have not yet been
made public. Mr. Woodward is a mem
ber of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers of New York City.— Albany

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 2, 1897-,
NEGROES CLAIM
CIVIL RIGHTS
They Insist Upon Equal
Privileges in Public
Baths.
A Social Club of Colored People
. ' Will Back the Suit Against""
Adolph Sutro.
Superintendent Harrison Says He Has
No Knowledge of the Alleged
Kefusal.
Superintendent Harrison of tho Sutro
baths, when seen yesterday in regard to
the suit brought by the colored man. John
Harris, against Adolph Sutro for $10,000
because he was refused the privilege of a
bath in the big establishment out nt the
ocean beach, said that neither he (Harri
rison) not any one else in authority there
knew anything about the alleged refusal
till they saw the story published in The
Cat.l. If any one under Harrison had
prevented the negro from going into the
water he says the matter would have been
reported to him, but neither, the ticket
sellers at the door nor any of his assist
ants at the baths have any knowledge of
the affair.
""Negroes,'' he said, ""so long as they are
•-ober and well behaved are allowed to en
ter the baths as spectators, but are not
permitted to go in the wa*er. It is not
a matter of personal feeling with us but of
business necessity. It would ruin our
oaths here because the white people would
refuse to us.- them if the negroes were al
lowed equal privileges in that way. No one
could in equity expect us to make such a
sacrifice. 1 do not think sucn a case could
ever be won against us. Public sentiment
would te too strongly in opposition for
any law to force such a commingling of
tue white and colored races. Ido not be
lieve the case will ever come to trial.""
""Some of the young men in the bath,""
continued he, ""might have told the col
ored man he could not go in and no ap
peal have been made to the superintend
ent. If he had applied to me,"" said Har
rison, ""the money he claims to have paid
for his ticket would have been promptly
refunded.""
As to the motive of the application for
a bath and the suit Harrison could guess
no more than any-one else. ""It may have
b*en intended as a test case, as no such
question has ever come up here before, or
it may have been prompted in spite by
some enemy of Mr. Sutro. Never since
the baths were opened in March, 1896, has
a colored person attempted to mingle
with the whites in the water. I noticed id
the papers a short time ago that the
Grand Army of the Republic had consid
ered this question of mingling with the
negroes and had decided that socially
they could not expect to be with the
whites. 1 think this decision would ap
ply to bathing together.""
Adolph Sutro's son, Edgar Sutro, when
seen in regard to Harris' suit, said he
knew nothing of either it or the refusal to
let him bathe until he read it in The Call.
He did not wish to be quoted as to his
opinion of the result of the suit. He was
confident that it would be ruinous to al
low negroes in the baths, because tbe
white people would be unwilling to min
gle witn them. There were not colored
people enough here to justify separate
baths for them on a large scale, ana he
could see no remedy. He did not antici
pate much trouble from the following up
of this attempt to get in, because he be
lieved the influential and better class of
colored people recognized the correctness
of the present arrangements, and had no
wish to force themselves into mingling
with th. whites when the whites did not
wish it.
The Assembly Club, which is social
organization, comprisinga membership ol
165 of the better class of colored people in
this City, is very much interested in the
suit, and is prepared as a body to back up
with financial aid and all their influence
either this case or any other brought by a
negro to teat the rights of their race in
this matter.
A. L. Dennis, president of this club, said
last night that the social organization of
which he is the head had been largely in
strumental in securing the pafsatre of the
civil rights bill in the last Legislature,
known as the Dibble b 11. They had a
fund set apart fjr that special purpose.
Therefore they are much interested in
having the new law brought to proof.
The bill was to have became operative
in sixty days after passage and sine*.
April 29 it has been the law of California
that no railways, hotels, restaurants, bar
ber-shop!-, batnboases and other like insti
tutions licensed to serve the public shall
discriminate against any well behaved
citizen, no matter what his color.
The Assembly Club appointed a civil
rights committee to work for the passage
of the Dibble bill, and when it became a
law they adjourned not to meet again till
a test case was made under the law, but
were to ro to work ass sting it in securing
subscriptions and otherwise. Tue ma
chinery therefore is all ready for an or
ganized effort to make the bill effective.
The club does not know John Harris
and has had no hand in bringing or sug
gesting the suit. But the personality of
the man makes no difference, as they will
work for the principle of the thing. They
deprecate any suit brought from a merce
nary motive and aim only to secure recog
nition of equal rights for their race.
Blaicr's Whist.
Speaking of protocols and treaties Mr.
Labouchere once /told this story: ''Years
ago I was in America and went down
with the English Minister in the United
States to a small inn in Virginia, where
we were to meet Mr. Marcy, the then
United States Secretary of State, and a
reciprocity treaty between Canada and the
United States was to be quietly discussed.
Mr. Marcy, the most genial of men, was
cross a*, a bear. He would agree to noth
ing. 'What on earth is the matter with
your chief?' I said to a secretary who ac
companied him. 'He does not have his
rubber of whist,' said the secretary. After
this every night the Minister and I played
at whist with Mr. Marcy and ids secre
tary and every night we lost. The stakes
were trifling, but Mr. Marcy felt flattered
in beating ihe Britishers at what he called
their own game. His good humor re
turned and every morning when the de
tails of the treaty were being discussed
we had our revenge and scored points for
Canada."" V.
Selling Liquor from a Bicycle.
Samuel Coffee of Paulson, Armstrong
County, is in jail on charges of illegal
liquor selling. Mr. Coffee ran the original
bicycle speak-easy, vHe purchased a v ' 97
model bicycle and carted his stock in
trade about on his wheel. When he met
a party of men they all drank from the
same canteen, which was; fastened se
curely to the frame of his wheel. He was
supplied with » large bottle full .of big
sugar pills. These pills he retailed at 20
cents each. He called himself a doctor
and gave each of bis patients a drink
from ""his tin can to wash the pill down.
He is said to have had the largett; and
most lucrative medical practice in' Arm
strong County. — Philadelphia Public

NEW STEAMERS
FOR THE NORTH
May Shortly Ply Between
Vladivostok and San
Francisco.
Rapid Progress in the Construc
tion of the Trans-Siberian
Railway. ,
When the Line Is Finished the Time
Prom Here to St. Petersburg Will
Be Twenty-Seven Days.
Kir Alexeieff, who will represent the
Russian. lmperial Minister of Finance
in Korea, and Lieutenant Garfield of the
Russian diplomatic service, arrived in San
Francisco yesterday and registered at the
Palace Hotel. They will sail for the
Orient on the steamer China f next Thurs
day. Russia has large and rapidly devel
oping interests m Korea, and it is the
policy of the empire to employ accom
plished and able tepresentatives in that
region. Mr, Alexeieff holds tbe rank of
Councillor of State. He has had military
as well as civil . training. Mr. Garfield is
familiar with affairs in the Orient and
attaches great importance to the construc
tion of the great railroad across Siberia,
which will, within the next three years,
connect St. Petersburg with the Pacific
Ocean. EfBHHm
Speaking of this great enterprise at the
Palace Hotel last night, Mr. Garfield said
that within twelve months a line of
steamships would be established between
San Francisco and Vladivostok, the east
ern terminal station of the great railway.
The distance from Vladivostok to St.
Petersburg is 10.000 versts or 7736 miles.
He figures steamer time between San
Francisco and Vladivostok at fifteen
days and the time by rail from Viadivo
stock to St. Petersburg twelve days,
making twenty-seven days for the whole
trip. hen this route is open to freight
and passenger the Canadian Pacific
will have a competitor jn a commercial
sense, that cannot be ignored. It is well
known to the. Russian engineers that a
port larther south than Vladivostok will
be reached by rail, and many predict that
Chemulpo, the seaport of Seoul,* will ulti
mately become the terminal station of the
Russian railway.
A volunteer line of Russian steamers
now makes the run from Odessa and Biack
Sea ports to Vladivostok. Fifteen ships
are now in the trade ana four fast steamers
will be put in service within the next
year. The great commercial triumph for
Russia will come when the lino of ships is
established between San Francisco and
Vladivostok.
Next year the Siberian road will be com
pleted from Moscow to Irkutsk. Two
large boats have been built in the United
States to navigate BaiKal Lake.
These boats will transfer trains in the
same manner that trains are transferred
at Benicia. The lake, in the mountains
of Siberians said to be the highest body of
water in the world and also the deepest
body of fresh water known.
It is predicted that the opening of the
Trans-Siberian Railway will turn the tide
of tourist travel to the route leading from
San Francisco to . St. Petersburg.- '-. Surely
travelers around the world will accept tbat
route either going or returning. What
Siberia will produce for the world's traffic
remains to be determined. It is known to
possess wonderful resources of timber and
mineral wealth.
Bicycles on Towpaths.
Sunerintendent George \V. Aldridge of
the Public Works Department bas an
overweening ambition to be Governor,
and one year ago, in his desire to have the
support of the wheelmen vote, he gener
ously donated the canal towpaths as
bicycle wheelways. As superintendent of
the canal system he threw open to the
wheelmen the use of the towpaths, and i
they were not slow to take advantage of i
the offer. Now Mr. Aldridge is being ;
pestered with complaints coming from
canal boatmen, who say that their mules
shy at bicycles and have, in some in
stances, fallen into the canal as tbe result
of a glance at a passing bicyclist. The
superintendent is trying to figure out just
what he shall do. Two courses present
themselves, either to force the canal
mules to wear toggles and blinders or else
to compel wheelmen and wheelwomen to
wear costumes on the towpaths that will
be warranted noi to .care the patient but
shy mules. — Troy Press.

LOST HIS LIFE
FOR HIS DOG
In Trying to Save the Ani
mal James Petersen
Was Drowned.
He' Thought It Was Going to
Fall Into the
Bay, A
The Dog Did His Best to Save His
Master/but Help Game
Too Late.
James Petersen, a boy who lived with
his parents at Railroad and Eighth ave
nues, was drowned in the bay at the foot
of First avenue last evening at 5 o'clock.
It was a dog that caused him to lose his
life. In a brave but vain effort to save his
pet from a drenching he toppled into the
water and was drowned. The dog, in
turn, made a hero of itself in attempting
to save its master, bat after the waves had
closed over the boy's head for the third
time it ceased its efforts and hurried
home as though to tell the story of the
tragedy.
Young Peterssn, accompanied by his
dog, left home early in the afternoon for a
stroll. The youngster wandered over to
South San Francisco, along the edge of
the bay. - He reached the old culvert at
the foot, of First avenue, and there lost
his life.
Several planks covering the culvert are
missing and tho boy was forced to cross a
stringer that spanned the water. He ac
complished this perilous feat without ac
cident and whistled to his dog to follow.
Tbe intelligent pet be. an the journey
and had almost reached ihe opposite side
when itslipped and, as its master thought,
was about to fall into the bay. The boy I
sprang out on the stringer to save his dog
from falling, lost his balance and toppled
into the water.
The dog reached firm ground without
mishap and th-n noticed his master's
struggle. With a startled whine it sprang
into the bay and swam to the drowning
boy's de.
Petersen grasped his pet around the
body, and master and dog sank beneath
the waves. They soon reappeared, how
ever, and Petersen shouted for aid.
William O'Connel 1 , a young man who
resides in the Cole Hotel al the Potrero,
saw the drowning boy aud hurried to the
rescue. When he reached the shore near
the culvert the boy and dog had disap
peared a second time. He threw off his
clothes, nevertheless, and swam to where
he saw the boy sink, in the hope that he
would be able to grasp him when he came
up for the last time.
In this he failed, as the boy and the dog
came to the surface some distance from
him and before he could reach them they
again sank beneath the water. »
O'Connell continued swimming around
for some time until he no. iced the dog
swimming several yards away from him.
The intelligent animal was scanning the
surface of the water as. he swam in ex
pectation that the drowned boy would
again appear and was waiting to aid him.
The boy did not again come to the sur
face, however, until life was extinct.
When he went down the third lime bis
arms did not release his pet until uncon
sciousness relieved his terror.
O'Connell and the dog swam round fora
while longer and then made their way to
the shore.
The dog, almost exhausted, hurried to
his master's home. O'Connell was about
to return to his home when the body of
the drowned boy came to the surface. He
swam out and drag.cd it ashore.
The body was removed to the Morgue.
Last Night'-. Alarms.
An alarm was sounded from box 412 at 9:15
o'clock last night for a fire in a two-story
frame dwelling owned and occupied by P.
Runoury, 2526 Tayler street. The cause of the
tire, which damaged the building to the ex
tent of $1200, is unknown.
The aiarm irom box 263 at 10:30 P. M. was
for a fire caused by an overheated range in a
building owned by John Myer and occupied by
H. M. Friese as a saloon and Martin Freichs as
a restaurant, corner 01 Main and Bryant
streets. The damage to the building and fur
uiture amounted to about $1000.
Chicago has one buildinsr. known as the
Green Tree Inn, which has reached the
venerable ajr*-, for Chicago, of 63 years.
The local Historical Society has been
advised to buy and preserve the interest
ing relic of antiquity.

A TRYING SITUATION.
They are ill-informed, indeed, who
have not heard of that ravenous insect
the New Jersey mosquito. Not long
ago a swarm of these pests stung a
baby to death. Now comes an account
of one of these borers getting away
with a stalwart United States soldier.
At Governor's Island the other day the
troops were out for dress parade. Pri
vate Flynn was in the ranks. No soon
er bad ""attention"" been called and the
men brought to that rigor of precision
that in military regulation forbids a
head to be moved, or a hand raised
from the piece carried, than one of
Jersey's greatest and boldest mos
quitos sailed across the bay, alighted on
Flynn's neck and proceeded—evidently
aware of the helpless condition of the
man—to insert his •.nil just behind
Flynn's right ear and get to work.
Flynn flinched but dared not lift a
hand to smash his enemy. Nor could
he take the risk of punishment by so
much as wagging his head, though it
would have mattered little for the gen
uine Jersey insect leaves his victim for
no such small thing as that. The dress
parade was long and the mosquito was
industrious. • At last when ' parade
rest"" was given, Flynn fell down in his
tracks limp and insensible. In the hos
pital the surgeons found the man's
clothing literally saturated with blood.
They calculated he had lost all a strong
man could afford to, and something
more. The Jersey drill had managed to
bore into and sever a smaJl artery, and
the surgeons say that had a large ar
tery been penetrated, the man s life
could not have been saved. So, while
the Jersey breed of mosquitoes has
heretofore, when on death intent, taken
those somewhat beneath its size, as
when it killed the Jersey baby, it has
now grown so bold that it lays low the
flower of the United States army.
Which recalls the fact that, in all seri
ousness. State scientific officials are
now studying ways and means of kill
ing off the mosquito in New Jersey. At
present their advice is that the breed
ing places of these pests be sprayed
with coal oil. They say that the oil
spreads over the water whence the in
sect comes, and kills the beginning of
mosquito life. If this is true, then a
simple and effective, and a compara
tively cheap specific has been found.
But up on the Klondyke, toward which
a goodly number of Californians are
now headed, they have mosquitoes beside
■which those of the Jersey breed are pig
mies, and the viciousmss of which is so
much greater than that of the Jersey
insect that the latter is not to be men
tioned in the same day. The Klondyke
mosquito* it is asserted by returned
miners, thinks nothing of boring
through a buck glove, while a felt hat
These pests flourish with the thermom
eter away down to zero, and they come
up out of moss-covered lands beneath
the green cover of which there is eter
nal ice. The naturalists will explain
this, of course, and satisfy a curious
world how it can be that mosquitoes
and snow and ice are in such accord.
Coal oil in that region, evidently, will
not serve the purpose to which we are
assured it may be successfully applied
in the low lands and temperate climes.
WAGES OF WORKMEN.
M. Emile Levasseur in the ""Revue
Bleue."" makes a study of the conditions
of wage earners in France and in the
United States. This able member of
the National Institute of ar
rives at the conclusion that as a rule
wages of workmen in the United States
are very much higher than similar
wages for like service in France: that
in the United States there is the most
enormous development and use of ma
chinery; finally that in the United
States the workman lives better and
consumes more and a higher grade of
goods than does the workman in any
other part of the world.
He makes careful comparison of
prices In the United States and in
France, and finds that the average
price of goods consumed by workmen
is but very little higher in the United
States than in France. Rent is higher
in America, and the American requires
better accommodations than the French
worker. The American, he says, has
a larger house, more comforts and
greater conveniences than the workers
of France. He concludes his paper,
which is an exhaustive one, and ap
pears to be the result of serious study
and much personal investigation, as
follows:
Wages are n»t, as many seem to
think, something arbitrary, to be fixed
according to the needs of the workers
or the demands of trades unions. They
depend on several causes, of which the
principal is the total amount of wealth
previously existing or produced at any
given time by labor, and the average
quantity of wealth produced by the
individual worker. The wealth pio
dui < d is divided between the three fac
tors of production: capital, the man
agers of industry and the workers.
There is always a question as to the
rate in which this distribution shall be
made, particularly as to the respective
shares of the managers and their em
ployes, but the wages can in no case,
under penalty of ruin for the industry,
equal the total value of the product.
We must admit, therefore, that the
productivity of labor is one of the prin
cipal causes which regulate wages.
Now, in the first place, the American
worker is equipped with the machinery
which can make his labor most pro
ductive, and employers are always dis
posed to perfect this machinery, since,
though paying higher wages, they real
ize larger profits than from handwork.
In the second place, the workers are
accustomed to work very rapidly, and
their democratic and individualistic ed
ucation gives them an energy which is
a characteristic of the American work
man.
And, finally, there is a constant de
mand in America for a very large pro
duction of wealth to satisfy the needs
of a population of more than 70,000
--iNM, which consumes each year an
enormous quantity of goods of all
kinds.
In the recent report of the Chief En
gineer, the recommendation was made
that a chemical engine be added to the
Sacramento Fire Department. This ad
vice has the virtue of age. It has been
repeated year after year with uniform
gravity and unvarying emphasis. But
this persistence appeals to have tittle
effect upon the city legislature. Of
course the excuse is made every year
that economy is necessary and the
chemical engine proposition can wait.
That is error; it cannot afford to wait
without the danger to householders
being augmented. For as the city grows
fires become more frequent and the de
mands upon the Fire Department more
exacting. Now as a chemical engine is
lighter than any other it can reach the
scene ot a fire more easily and speedily,
as much damage is done to goods, as a
rule, by water as by fire, but the chemic
al engine uses no water to speak of. The
actual economy is therefore in procuring
the needed fire extinguisher. Instead of
figuring upon schemes to buy more
pumps for the Water Works and to
throw.away money in experiments with
filter beds, let there be steps taken to
procure a first-class chemical engine for
the city Fire Department.
That Secretary Bliss should have
deemed it wise to issue a warning
against the rush of foolhardy gold
seekers to the Yukon section so late in
the season, justifies the protest of the
""Record-Union"" put into print two
weeks ago, warning the prospectors
against attempting to cross the passes
above Dyea, before next June. The
fear the other day expressed that there
will be terrible suffering in these passes
intensifies. Aleardy there are numbers
turning back, but there are hundreds
so far over now, that to go ahead will
be less perilous than to retreat, ami
these, we very much fear, will suffer
terribly, and many among them will
be emblamed by death in the snow and
ice of the upper Yukon.
The State Department has at last re
plied to the voluble Professor Elliott.
The response is a crusher. It shows
that Elliott is not now, and has not
been for years, connected with the
Smithsonian Institution or any Govern
mental department; that when he was
employed he made reports so inaccu
rate, absurd and disrespectful, that
they were refused print, and from that
date this bitterly prejudiced man has
had no connection with any depart
ment of the Federal Government. In
other words, the State Department po
litely dubs Elliott a fraud and a nui-
Our esteemed contemporary, the San
Francisco ""Chronicle,"" inclines to
humor now and then, but it really owes
Mary Ellen an apology, when it says that
her campaign for Governess of Kansas
is looking up along with other things
that are flat on their bicks. Why, Mary's
campaign is on its feet, good square
toed and long-heeled feet, good square
nothing under the blessed sun that can
defeat Mary, but an insufficiency of votes
In the convention. All creation ought to
wish Mary success; just that one folly
is needed to round out Kansas as an
Here we go, down and lower still. A
siiver dollar in bullion value is to-day
worth 43 cents, minus, while August
wh-at touches 87' ->c a bushel. How
about that Bryanic maxim with which
the air was resonant last summer, that
anywhere at any time an ounce of silver
will buy a bushel of wheat?
The story comes for the twentieth
time that Weyler ""is about to be re
moved."" Let us hope, for humanity's
sake, that it is this time verity. If
nut Weyler will have to fence Havana
to keep the insurgents out. He appears
to be unable to check them with bis
sugar cane and barbed-wire trochas.

I Stockton Independent: The difference
between silver Republicans and Bry »n
Democrats is growing less day by day.
,It raises a suspicion that some of the
| silver Republican papers are seeking to
| fill the long-felt want of Democratic
papers where the ""Square out"" article
' has not been able to maintain itself
and find the silver cause a eonveni ait
gang-platfk into the Democratic camp.

TIME TO INTERFERE.
Oakland Telegram: It is about time
i the Federal Government took a hand in
preventing under-equipped vessels from
, clearing for Alaskan ports. Men in
! their mad desire to reach the chosen
, land are not great sticklers about the
; methods of reaching there. As a con
• sequence everything that gives evidence
jof remaining on top of the water has
j been put into commission and iadenod
I down to the gunwales, these poorly
I equipped vessels are sent out, with hun
dreds of passengers, to try their luck
jon the yeasty deep. It may be that
accompanied by good fortune they will
i safely reach their destination, but the
j odds against them are too many to
] permit of them being granted clear
ances.
AN AFFIDAVIT READY.
| Los Angeles Times: When one reads
' the stories about the roughness of the
: trip into the northern gold fields, and the
j lack of placer gold in Peru, he must con
clude that even a small bird in the hand
in California is worth whole mountains
full of bears, mosquitoes and hostile In
dians in the lands that lie afar. The
stories that glitter in the newspapers
are alluring, no end, but Davy Crock
ett's advice is a good thing to bear in
mind just at this juncture. It will be
found much more enjoyable to read of
fat diggings than to go to them and
find all the good claims taken up, the
mercury at 70 degrees below zero and a
| fit of homesickness on for a sight of
I the billowing fields and fruited orchards
!of good and glorious old California. If
jan affidavit to this is required it will be
1 furnished.
FAKE CORRESPONDENTS,
i Alameda Argus: The big newspapers
jare making people laugh by their ridic u
| lous pretensions regarding their corres-
I pondents dispatched to the Klondike,
j They get ahold of a man who has made
I arrangements to go, buy him a $4
[camera or two bits' worth of bazar note
J paper, take his picture in Arctic cos
i tume, and herald him forth as a brave
' spirit who leaves all the comforts of a
good warm home to brave tho regions of
i the Arctic zone for the express purpose
|of recording his opinions for its columns.
'Special correspondents to the Klondike
I are so plentiful that if the natives can
j understand it they must be astonished
jat the immense number of people it re
quires to describe their country.
RAISE MORE CORN.
Tacomo Ledger: Kansas is again to
the front with a tale of woe, this time
Ithe alleged interference in State affairs
by a Federal Court. If Kansas would
j take the old-time advice to raise more
j corn and less hell, she would do as well
!as could be expected, considering cli
jmatic diawbacks. Kansas people w übl
i not be entirely happy, however, without
jsome kind of a ""scrap"" on their hands.
A SAD SACRIFICE.
He Never Could Love Another as
He Had Her.
He grazed upon her motionless form.
He was rich, but he remembered thai
in his days of poverty she had ever
been true and faithful, even by his side,
with never a word of complaint.
But riches had flowed in on him, and
! he had determined to get rid of her and
put another in the place she had so
I long held in hfs affection.
Still, in spite of his determination,
there was a look of sadness in his face
as he murmured: ""Yes, we must part.
Years and years and years we have
been together in sunshine and in rain
She made no reply.
""Ah! I remember,"" he continued,
""how proud I felt the day I called you
mine, when I felt that I was earning
enough to possess you as my own. You
have watched my business grow from
nothing to its present great proportions,
| and you helped me make the fortune I
now possess; but to-day we separate,
never, never to meet again.""
She gave no indication that she had
heard him, and her face still retained
its fixed, mute look.
""In the old days,"" he went on, ""I
would never have thought of such an
j act, but time and customs change, and
; while I admit that I can never love the
! one who will succeed you as I have and
j do you, still my position in life demands
! that you must be sacrificed.""
Still not a word —not even a sob.
j ""Yes, all is at an end at last. We
i shall never see each other again, but
ever shall I thfnk of— —""
At this point a wagon drove up in
j front of the door, and the wealthy to
j bacconist helped the driver off with a
wooden figure of an up-to-date bicycle
girl, who was placed in the spot occu
pied for years by the figure of an In
dian maiden, who had grown old and
whose nose had been chipped off, and
who the same night was made into
kindling wood. —St. Louis Post-Dis

Two Famous Log Cabins.
At the Tennessee Centennial Exposi
tion are to be exhibited the old cabin
birthplaces of two famous American
citizens. These cabins are genuine, as
certified by affidavits in the possession
of the owner and exhibitor.
The Rev. W. G. Bigham. a Methodist
embraced parts of Todd and Hardin
minister, while traveling a circuit which
Counties, Ky., bought the two log cab
ins and the land on which they stood, j
One of the cabins was built by Tom
I.inkhorn. and in ft he lived wtth his
wife, Nancy Hanks. In this cablr..
without a floor. Abe Lincoln was born
in the year 1809. Every' log. except a
few that did not withstand the ravages
of time and the weather, is preserved.
The other cabin is one in whicli tho
President of the late Confederacy was
bom. It came from near Fairview,
Todd County, Ky. Mr. Davis was born
here in 1808, and when bti years old was
given a banquet by old citizens of Fair
view in the very same cabin. In re
sponding to a toast, he referred to the
! fact that he had stood in the halls of
I the Montezumas, in the halls of Con
gress, and fa other historic places in
! America and other countries, but none
jof these had stirred his emotions as
; much as when once again standing in
j the old cabin in which he was born. —

The Toastmaster's Nervousness.
Years and years ago, when the Press
I Club, of more or less blessed memory,
j was in existence, a British newspaper
I man—they call it a journalist on the
j other side—was at the club one even
j ing. He had been in Washington for
j some time, and was leaving next day.
! Carl Decker made a speech to him 
• Mr. So-and-So,"" he said, you have
spent some time with us, and you have
, made many friends. We have become
I attached to you. You are going away
; to-morrow, and we may never see y ju
again, but in order that you may al
: ways have something by which to re
: member us, on behalf of the Press
i Clul), I present you this ring.""
And then he struck the call-bell on
1 the reading table near hfm. The Eng
| iishman looked just a trifle bewildered
' for a bit, then he reached out his hand,
! thanked the club, and pocketed the
I bell. And—bless his simple English
I heart —next morning he told another
| newspaper man how kind the Press
! Club had been to him, and what a love
ly presentation speech Mr. Decker had
made. ""Mr. Decker must have been
; awfully nervous, you know,"" he said,
: ""though he didn't show it, for he said.
;'I present you this ring,' and, don't y'
know, it wasn't a ring at all; it was a
• bell."" —Washington Post.
How Fast.
This sounds as if it came from the
I variety stage. But as a matter of fact,
:is is history, for occasionally funny
j things do happen in the courts besides
! It was in a negligence case recently,
i and a good humored Irishman was a
witness.
The Judge, lawyers and everybody
I else were trying their best to extract
| from the Irishman something about the
speed of a train.
""Was it going fast?"" asked the Judge.
""Aw, yis. it were,"" answered the wit-
""How fast?""
""Oh, purty fasht, yer honor.""
""Well, how fast?""
""Aw, purty fasht.""
""Was it as fast as a man can run?""
""Aw, yis,"" said the Irishman, glad
that the basis for an analogy was sup
plied. ""As fasht as two mm kin run.""
—Buffalo Enquirer.
An Intelligent Listener.
A professor of mechanics at an Eng
lish college records that he once gave
a lecture upon the locomotive and was
! particulaily struck by the absorption
of one juvenile listener. He spoke to
this student after the lecture and
asked:
""Well. I suppose you understand all
about the locomotive now?""
""Yea,"" was the reply; ""all but one
thing.""
""And what is that?"" said the profes
sor, kindly.
""I can't make out what makes the
I locomotive move without horsss.""— Tid

The Escape of Kansas.
Bingham—Did you notice that those
i immense hailstones which fell In Kan
sas the other day, knocked out the
i brains of many animals?
Francis —Yes. Terrible, wasn't it?
i Bingham—lt was indeed. I suppose,
'if the storm had occurred in any other
I State but Kansas the brains of many
people, also, would have been knocked
out.

THE BUMBLEBEE.
! The Big Queen Bee Searches Cor a
Home in the Early Spring.
In early spring, when the meadows
, first take on a tinge of green, and the
appletrees put forth their rosy buds,
we may often see a single large bumble
bee flying low and swiftly back and
' forth across the lawns or pastures.
These great bees are the queens who
have just awakened from their long
winter's sleep, and are now seeking some
favored spot wherein to commence
housekeeping and found a colony; for
these insects, like their cousin, the
honeybees, live in colonies consisting of
i three classes, or castes—'drones,"" or
[males, ""queens,"" or females, and • work
ers."" When our big queen has at last
discovered a satisfactory building site,
usually a deserted mouse hole, she
cieans it of all rubbish and litter, and
j places within a ball of pollen, in which
i she lays her eggs. The young grubs
hatch out possessed with enormous ap
petites, and, feeding on the pollen, eat
[into it in all directions. At last, when
| fully grown and their craving for food
is satisfied, they spin cocoons of silk in
j the remains of the pollen, and change to
| pupae. While her family is thus sleep
ing quietly within their silken cells, the
! old queen is constantly at work, build-
I ing up and strengthening the cocoons
i with wax.
Finally, their sleep being over, the
pupa cases burst, and the young bees
come forth in all their glory' of black
and-golden livery and gauzy wings.
The first brood consists entirely of
workers, who immediately fall to and
relieve their tired mother-queen of all
work and duties, with the exception of
laying eggs. They fly hither and thither,
always busy and industrious, now
plunging into the center of a gorgeous
hollyhock or a sunny dandelion, or buz
zing about among the modest daisies, or
diving head first into some sweet
scented, aristocratic lily or rose, always
emerging from their quest for honey
covered with the golden dust of pollen.
The honey and the pollen thus gathered
are stored away, and the eggs laid in
the waxen cells from which the workers
issued; and the next brood, composed of
drones and young queens, feed upon this
store of nectar. —A. Hyatt Verrill in St.
Nicholas.
I Was Dreaming of Man.
I was dreaming of man and his mission;
His emergence from shadow, his too;
Of his love and the meaning behind it—
The divinely directed renewing
Of the diggers and reapers of earth.
I observed him, through childhood and
youth.
Taking note of his splendid unfolding
In the period of wooing and mating.
Through the years of his prime and de
cadence
He and I were as intimate brothers.
Standing holding his hand on his deathbed,
When his lips that were speechless moved
dumbly,
And his eyes sought the eyes of his idols
With a message of agonized yearning,
Back of tears that would come was the
question!
But I prayed to the God of my boyhood—
The approachable, lovable Father—
For the peace of the soul of the dying.
In the chancel I paused, looking long
On the clay so comi>osed and fair-seeming;
And 1 studied the words of the preacher,
Best the key be unconsciously spoken.
It is true of the word that is spoken
That it carries to each who may hear it
A suggestion unknown to the speaker.
But the preacher, despite of bis wrestling
In the closet with powers supernal,
Made it plain through his eloquent phrases
He was walking blind-eyed in the dark
ness.
I was close to the grave when the sexton,
Unobaerving the sobs of the children
Or the heart-broken cry of the mother,
With His spade threw the dirt on the cof
fin.
Long I mused in the evening at home
On the spirit that was and that vanished.

It looks as if silver might yet fall as low
as Bryanism.
The climb at the Chilkoot is no worse
than the climate at Dawson.
Why not call it Chilly Coot Pass? That's
the way the coots who go there feel.
Do not be afraid to stay with California
and work for her. She pays good wages.
What is most needed in San Francisco
at this time is a remedy for the tm levy
complaint.
Tte tugboat marriage industry may
bave to be dispensed with in the new era,
but the loss will be little.
The prospector does not envy the farmer
and the farmer is not envying the pros
pector. Everybody is happy.
Do not fail to see the exposition at the
Mechanics' Institute and post yourself on
the pure food supply of California.
There are still a few people who insist
that prosperity has not returned, but the
old calamity howl is no longer heard.
About all we can do for the Klondikers
is to wish them luck and get ready to
take up s&bscript-ons for a relief fund.
First the name was spelled Skagaway,
then Skaguay, then Skagua, and before
winter sets in It may be known as Skags.
The persistence with which the Cubans
continue to march on Havana without
ever getting there is becoming noticeable.
The approach of winter will soon cool
down the AlasKan excitement, but the
mining boom of California will go on as
briskly as ever.
As a rule Fresno keeps up with the pro
cession, but she has refused to join the
Klondike rn«b and has started a mining
excitement of her own.
It is evident that the early prospectors
of California overlooked about as much
ro!d as they found, and it may still be said
of our soil ""there's millions in it.""
The next time Henry of Orleans writes
an account of his travels he will take care
to write nothing likely to need revision
by a man with a fine Italian hand.
It will be noticed that very few Ohio
men are taking part in the rush to the
gold fields. It is an election year in that
State and they have ■ Klondike at home.
Eminent Frenchmen are not likely to
growl at the Italians very much since
Count Turin has given them an illustra
tion of tbe Italian method of rushing the
growler.
The Grand Army should assemble In
San Francisco next year to see how the
City has improved since the former visit.
We can show visible evidences of growth
that will astonish the veterans.
Mexico should be allowed a voice in the
international conference of the silver
question. She is as much interested as
any other power and moreover she would
cist her vote on the American side.
If half the people who say they are
going to the Klondike next spring keep
their words the wcods along th* Yukon
will ba full of them and the summer will
be the greatest picnic ever witnessed.
After Justice Field gets^'tbrough re
joicing over having broken the record for
length of service on the Supreme bench
he should re fleet a little on the fact that
by so doing be has violated all the prece
dents of the court.
Messages purporting to have been sent
out by Andree by means of pigeons are
being received with as cold a frost as any
they experienced in tbe frozen north.
No one, either in America or in Europe,
seems to warm up to tbem.
' In the course of a casual conversation
between two Santa Rosa editors occurs
the phrase, ""An insinuating, cozening
blackguard and coward."" The insertion
of tbe word ""cozening"" suggests that the
remark was intended to be an expression
of disesteem.
Between the Moslem fanatics among his
people on one side and British troops on
the other the unfortunate Ameer of Af
ghanistan is in a position from which it
seems impossible to escace, except by
crawling into a gimlet-hole and pulling
the hole in, too.
There is a gocd deal of curiosity in the
East to see what the gold Democrats will
succeed in doing in Ohio, lowa and Ken
tucky tbis year, ana the opinion prevails
that they will not poll votes enouch to get
out of the ""scattering"" column when the
tally-sheets are made up.
Lstus hope that no new mining camp
or district in this State will ever be called
Klondike. We have already overdone the
thing in the way of applying foreign
names to California localities, and the
sooner we have sufficient originality to be
distinctive in names, at least, the better
for us. v*
WORKING FOR CALIFORNIA.
All the events and forces of the time tend to strengthen tne hopes of Californians
and stimulate their energies. The rise in the prices of wheat and wool and fruit, the
increasing activity in m.tny lines of trade due to the Klondike excitement, the recent
rich gold discoveries in this State and the success attained in the entertainment of the
great cor. mi mof the Christian Endeavor A-sociation, serve the one end of rous
ing the people of California and impelling them to enterprises which will render the
coming year even more rrosperons than the present.
In every part of the State evidences are to be seen of the revived energy and re
stored confidence of the people. Farm crops have been remunerative, mills and shops
are running full time, and in most cases 1-handed; the tendency of wages is up
ward; in somo localities there is a demand for mors workers; capitalists are giving
favorable consideration to lares undertakings, and money has come forth from its
hiding-place to provide means for realizing the bright hopes of the now era of pros
perity.
It is inevitable that at snch a juncture the prevailing spirit of the people should
be one of harmony and genera! good will. Only narrow natures and petty souls are
at this time harking back to old issues and striving to keep alive antagonisms that
should ba allowed to perish and be buried with the dead controversies that caused
tbem. The great mass of the people look to the future and are marching forward.
They reed aright tbe signs of the times and are aware that if a due amount of co-op
erative energy is exerted by Californians tbe prosperity and general improvement of
the coming decade will far exceed any the State has ever known.
Among the many movements undertaken in variou* places for advancing the
welfare of the commonwealth those of most ceneral interest at this time are the steps
taken to bring the annual encampment of the Giand Army to this City next year f
and to promote a larger tourist travel to the counties and attractive localities of Cen
tral and Northern California. Each of these If successfully carried out will prove of
large advantage to the State, and, even if unsuccessful so far as the immediate objects
are concerned, will prove cf no little value to our interests in years to come.
Tbe prospect of inducing the Grand Array veterans to make another visit to San
Francisco is fairly promising, and we may also procure for the State tbe advantage of
the ennual assembly of the educators of the Union. The movement toward bringing
Eastern tourists to the middle and northern counties of the State will surely attain
its object if rightly and energetically pushed forward. Here then are two feasible
enterprises on which a general co-operation can be given. Each contains within it
the probability of good for a!!, and each should be supported by all. About the best
work a man of means and influence can do now is to work for California and stay
with it.
THE WEST ASSAILED.
At this period of a dawning prosperity,
when a glorious smi'e si uses the broad
face of the great West, when our grain
crops are as big almost as the farmer could
desire and the prices are tall enough to
make him dance with delight, when every
body on this side of the Mis issippi is ex
periencing the happiest feelings that have
come to his lot for these last four years
and the good-times cheer is heard where
the calamity howl long ago died away, it
is the unkindest kind of a cut for any of
our beloved cousins in the far East to stab
us with the assertive of disloyalty.
Little Rhode Island, through the me
dium of the Providence Journal, is jump-
ing upon the wide West with both feet
The Journal has been told by somebody
that secession talk has been heard some
where in this direction. As to who
breathed the calumny or what may be
the color of the hair of the person who is
thus halfway accused of wanting to tear
himself away from the best all-round
Nation on earth and set up shop all alone
by himself, the Journal doesn't pretend to
say.
Nevertheless, we are in duty bound, as
it were, to be shocked at this at.empt of
an envious bend to pink us with a jour
nalistic florette. We were always rather
partial to ""Rhody"" on account of her size.
What has she done? She has boldly de
clared that the West is not as law-abiding
as the East; that the West has more po
litical power than it is entitled to, and
that tbe Senators and Representatives,
especially the former, exert an undue in
fluence upon legislation at Washington,
""thanks to what has been called the bene
ficial balance between our Federal and
State authority, but what has come to be
in practice anything but beneficent and
anything but a balance.""
We never expected such an onslaught !
as this from Little Rhody. It is too tad
that some of her neighbors hasn't in- !
formed her that the West is very largely
populated with Easterners; that Eastern- j
ers laid the foundations ol Western great
ness and laid them well; that more East
erners are coming West every day to take
aavantag? of the many superior oppor- j
tunities offered here, and that we enter
tain a respect for the laws ns deep and
sincere as ever characterized the people of
New England.
Little Rhody should never broach the
subject cf any undue power of Western
States by reason of the Senatorial repre
sentation. Rhody herself has two Sena-
tors and yet has hardly enough land within
her borders to give esch of them a farm.
To show onr generosity, even in the face
of Little Rhody's exhibition of temper,
we would willingly, ii possible, double her
area by adding to it one of our average
sized California ranches.
THE GOLD DEMOCRATS.
The gold wing of the Democratic party
is to make a vigorous campaign in the ap
proaching elections in Ohio, lowa and
Kentucky, and there is a widespread
interest in the country as to what show- j
ing the National Democracy, as it is .
ca led, will make.
List year the followine of Candidate
Palmer in Ohio and lowa was hardly ;
worthy of consideration, but it certainly '
defeated Bryan in Kentucky, where the !
Palmer vote was 5000 and McKinley's
plurality over the Nebraska candidate less
than 300. Election statistics prove tbat '
the Paimerites last year cast less than j
two-thirds of 1 per ceat of the total vote of
the three States in question, or about
11,500 in a total of 1,991.800. This doesn't ;
seem to phease the gold Democrats, who
appear to be as full of hope now as the
average Klondiker before he reaches ;
Alaska,
Mr. Bynum. their leader, asserts tbat ;
the smallness of the Pa- iner vote last year
was due simply. to the circumstance that
a great majority of the gold Democrats, in :
order to insure the defeat of Bryan, voted ;
directly for tho Republican candidate.
He believes tbat in the coming contests i
these stray voters will return to the fold,
and that they will hold the balance of
power in the three important States men
tioned above/as between the Republicans
j and the Bryan Democrats.
It is just possible that Mr. Bynum is j
hugging the ver. est kind of a delusion,
and that, with the close of elect on day, j
his hopes will melt like the icicle which !
the Arab toox for a diamond.
Nevertheless, the fight wil! be watched
with special regard for this doubtful gold
element, which boldly lays c aim to 50,00)
votes in the State of Kentucky, and which
will endeavor to make its influence re
spected through an aggressive right in the
other two commonwealths.
The Oakland Tribune avers that the in
habitants of Auburn are so patriotic their
children are born with Auburn hair. Inas
much as the Tribune valiantly refrained
from calling it ""Auburn locks,"" any ap
pearance of premeditated jocularity that
the remark might otherwise have indi
cated will be studiously overlooked.
It Ls easy enough for society to execute
anarchists alter they are captured, but
there seems no way to capture or even
spot them until they have killed some
body whom- the world can ill afford to
lose.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST IS, -897.
OUE GEEAT NAVAL SYSTEMS.
In discussing naval warfare of tbe
future, P. H. Colomb, a noted British en
gineer and an authority on naval matters,
expresses the opinion that the present
trend of naval construction is not accord
ing to the best dictates o: reason. Eng
land, for instance, is building numerous
battle-ships armed witn torpedoes and, in
addition, she is multiplying her torpedo
vessels. Other nations are doing pretty
much the same thing. The small destroy
ers are for short-range work, while the
progress of naval gunnery has been con
stantly in the direction of long-range
fighting.
Tbe Dig battle-ships, in fact, are specially
prepared to fight a long-range action so
far as their guns are concerned ; and as the
important weaoon is the torpedo, if it
comes to short-range action, it follows
that if two hostile mixed fleets of battle-
ships and torpedo- meet they must
either work for long range with their guns
or short range with their torpedoes.
""If they choose lone range,"" says Mr.
Colomb, ""the torpedo- vessels are no use; it
they choose short range, these are a work
of supererogation, a danger and an ele
ment of confusion. In tbe melee which
they establish there can be no guarantee
that they will not be firing toriedoes into
their own ships and tbat their own ships
will not be tiring guns into them in mis
take.""
If torpedo-vessels be regarded as pro
tectors of battle-ship?, then if the battle
be at long range there is nothing to pro
tect, and if at short range it is impossible
for the torpedo-vessels to protect any
thing. ""The idea of protection of battle
ships involves a preliminary battle be
tween the torpedo-fleets.""
The British naval critic avers that
surely one power of two will see she use
lessness of such a condition of things, and
""if the other insists on putting to sea
with a mixed fleet the firsr will send an
overwhelming fleet of torpedo- vessels only
to settle first with the enemy's torpedo
vessels and then with the enemy's battle
fleet.""
The existing position of the British
navy Mr. Colomb declares to be an end
less tangle and he wants to see it straight
ened out and given the stability which the
safety of the empire demands. As nearly
all the nations are in the same box with
Great Britain in this matter the situation
is a highly interesting one and gives rite
to any amount of speculation with refer
ence to naval systems on the propositions,
""Where are we?"" and ""Whither are we
drifting?""
SALVATION ARMY PAEMS.
The project to colonize the sugar-beet !
lands of the Salinas Valley through the
agency of the Salvation Army has aroused
throughout this commonwealth an inter
est in keeping with its promise and im
portance. A special value, therefore, at
this time and in this particular field of
work is the article in the August Forum,
by Commander Booth-Tucker, on the
""Farm Colonies of the Salvation Army.""
The leader of the Salvationists in Amer
ica believes that the ultimate and only ra
tional cure for the congestion of our great
cities is to remove the surplus population
to the land. The trouble with the pauper
policy and criminology of most civilized
countries to-day is that ""instead ol the
surplus being removed it is accumulated
in reservoirs of ever-increasing magni
tude, where, without any natural outlet,
the waters stagnate, breeding corruption,
disease and death."" Commander Tucker
would have those same waters judiciously
distributed over the arid surface of the
sparsely populated soil of our vast agri
cultural areas, where they would produce
a rich harvest of honest, self-supporting
husbandmen, He declares tbat the di
vorce of the small landed proprietor from
the soil has been the great cause of the
depressed state of agriculture, and tbat 10
assure permanent prosperity on a rational
basis the balance of the population must
be restored from the city to the country.
""The surplus population of our cities,""
contends the writer, ""neither can nor will
conduct their own exodus to the land of
peace and plenty, which might and ought
to be theirs."" They must have suitable
leaders, who understand the r habits and
have no axes to grind, and capital is de
sired, in its own interest, to afford th«
wotkingman a fair chance of getting at
the land.
The Salvation Army is eager to have
every effort of the kind, as in the case of
the Salinas colony, ""placed on a purely
commercial basis, under the personal
superintendence of business men of ap
proved probity, discretion and enerey.""
To carry out an exodus of an extensive
character— and we are told that there are
3,000,000 people in our large cities requir
ing to be handled ßooth-Tucker says an
agency is demanded which will combine
the qualifications of cheapness, honesty,
skill, numbers, self-sacrifice and the abil
ity to inspire confidence in those whom it
seeks to lead. The poor classes have con
fidence In the Salvation Army, and this
confidence has been created by years of
patient work, in which the qualitications
above enumerated have been amply exem
plified.
If the colossal work be now undertaken
in the many big cities of the land,"" as is
being done in ban Francisco, where prom
i Inent citizens, capitalists and business
j men are co-operating with the Salvation
ists in their scheme, there is a possibility
of the solution of the pauper problem iv
| America. The Salvation Army is organ
i z d throughout the Nation, and is in a
j position to handle an enterprise of Na
tional scope. Commander Booth-Tuck.
! thinks it can be proved that Mother Earth
is still big enough and fertile enough to
J provide food and work for many times
j over her existing family.
""The Salvation Army method of deal
: ing with the unemployed."" succinctly
'. says the leader of the organization in this
; country, ""is to place the waste labor on
j waste land by means of waste capital,
j thus combining the trinity of waste, the
separation of whic 1 means the destruc
tion of each, the co-operation of wnich
j means the prosperity of all.""
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
The Pacific Coast States have a strong I
champion of their interests in Minister ;
Merry, who is now on his way to his mis- ]
sion in the Central American States. He i
maintains that it is more important to :
tbe people of the United States that the '
Nicaragua canal should be properly con- i
structed than that it should be delayed as
a result of continued doubts and differ
ences of opinion as to the methods of con
struction : that it is a matter of such vital
moment that the prosperity of tbe entire
coast depends upon it, and that it has be
come equally as important as between the
East and West as were the ereat overland
railroads when they were first constructed.
He is the right man in the right place,
and will exert a direct and very effective
influence in bringing about the object of
so much earnest endeavor on the part of
statesmen ana people who know the im
mense value of the Nicaragua canal
project.
The only practicable method of con
struction at present is by means of a com
pany chartered by the United States Gov
ernment, and under tbe strict control of j
Uncle Sam, and Minister Merry believes
it to be the duty of every patriotic Ameri- j
can to work to the end that the great i
waterway may become a reality, with all ;
the blcs-ings it assures of trade, commerce
and National prestige, at tne earliest
period possible.

SOME NE-V WORDS DEFINED.
Terms in the Dingier ; Tariff Bill Not
Familiarly Known.
Rochester Post-Express.
The princip-1 ot one of the public schools of
Rochester gave the new tariff act as published
in the Pos -Express a thorough reading and
addresses a communication to the editor in
which he says:
Can you tnrow any light npon the meaning
of the following words which I found ia tbe
new tariff act:
Lame or lahn, section 179.
Bristings, section 258.
Revered, sections 312, 345,388.
Vitrages, section 339. - .""•
Skirted, section 336.
Gtirnetied, section 361.
One-line, section 402.
Dlanisidin, section 424. .
1 have consulted the latest editions ot the
three leading dlcllotianes and fall to find
these words. What do they mean?
It is singular that so many words in the new
tariff act are no', to be found in the dictiona
ries. We «re abie, however, to throw some
light on the meanings of them.
Lime or lahn — Tnese are adjectives applied
to wire, meaning wire that has been length
ened by pounding by heavy hammers.
Brislings— The name of. « small fish similar
to sardine?, caught in the Mediterranean and
in the Bay of Biscay, packed in oil and shipped
to this country. *
Revered— An adjective describing the man
ner of ornamenting handkerchiefs, lace and
linen goods. Little square holes are cut
around the edges of the goods.
Vitrages— A kind ot lace. We are unable to
give a particular description. The lace-nuyers
for our largest dry-goods houses do not know
exactly what kind of lace it is.
Seined— An adjective applied to wool. The
skirt of the fleece is the outer part about the
hindquarters. Skirted wool is wool from the
skirt of the fleece. -
Garnetted— Waste is said to Do garnetted
when it has been run through a machine pro
vided with attachments like rows ot pins, by
means of which foreign substances are re
moved.
One-line — Words descriptive of a peculiar
kind of paper used in making Jac guard designs
in weaving. In this country cardboard is gen
erally used.

a more particular description.
WAS IT HERR ANDREE'S BALLOON?
The Object Seen From the Steamship Dordrecht Near the White Sea on July 17.
[From sketches bt, Captain Lehman* and Chief Officer VUser on the Dutch steamer Dordrecht.}
Something over two weeks ago a letter
signed by the captain of the. steamer Dord
recht was published in a Gothenburg paper
in which the writer stated that he had seen in
the White Sea what he believed to be Andree's
balloon floating on the surface of the water.
Afterward this report was discredited by sev
eral captains, who thought the object seen by
the capiain of the Date- steamer was the
carcass of a dead whale. The London Dally
Graphic of August 2 gives an illustration of
the mrsterlous object as seen Dy those on
board the Dutch sieamer Dordrecht on July
17 and supDOsed by them to be the remains ot
WHEELS OF 1898.
New York snn.
Views on bicycles of next year's model are
numerous. In 1897 the price attracted more
attention than the wheel, but In 1893 the
money question will be subordinate. Cyclists
look upon the $100 bicycle as gone. The
standard price will be somewhere, we suppose,
between $75 and; Chainless wheels will
surely be prominent next spring, promising to
put the greasy chain wheels completely out of
mind. Tubing next year will be about the
same as it is now. Gears of high, low, and
medium size will be on the market for choice,
but during this season the liking for nigh
gears has developed greatly, probably as the
result of the greater strength which practice
has brought io the average leg.
The radical genius, who is being heard from,
asserts thai the 1898 bicycle will be operated
by either the arms or legs. This sounds more
cranky than Interesting.
The wheel's most vulnerable point, Its tire,
is being studied and experimented with, with
ardent desire for its improvement and with no
little hope. It must be possible to put into
the rubber some element thai would lessen its
slipping on wet pavements; and it seems ab
surd that wheels destined to pass over jagged
roads shou.d be left so puncturable. A less
puncturable tire and a tire which when in
flated will remain full indefinitely is greatly
needed.
In spite of the promise of 1898, however,
owners of good bicycles needn't worry. A good
bicycle to-day will be good next year.
PARLIAMENTARY RULES.
New York Mad and Express.
A curious point came up for discussion in
the English House of Commons one day re
cently, when Mr. Gedge submitted a memo
rial from his constituents of the town of
Walsall in typewritten manuscript. It is a
rule of the house that all petitions must be in
written or lithographic form and on this
ground the Speaker declined to consider the
honorable member's memorial. Mr. Gedge
urged its acceptance, saying that the rule was
adopted before typewriters were invented,
but he was unable to carry his point. He is
now planning to move an amendment to the
lule at the earliest opportunity. The same
rule applies to all of the official departments
of the British Government. All documents
that emanate from the various branches ot the
Ministry aro still written in longhand upon
the same kind of paper that has been in use
for several centuries, and Is manufactured ex
pressely ior them. No private individual is
allowed to u c e official paper for any purpose
whatever. Ana quill pens are still the ordi
nary instruments of literary labor in the ex
ecutive departments, as they are in the uni
versities, the courts and the old-fashioned
lawyers' office"". : *
THE ELASTICITY OF POLITICS.
Ncr York Tribune.
""There's a man who voted in both National
conventions, and for Bryan as well as for Mc-
Kinley,"" said a politician to-day, calling at
tention to the name of Charles S. Johnson,
who was yesterday appointed United Stales
District Judge for Alasks.""
""How did that hapjeii'.""'
""It was mis way: Johnson was a delegate
frcm Alaska to the St. Louis convent on, «nd
voted for th<» nomination of McKinley. After
the convention he went up to Cnicago to see
the Democratic show. There he fell in with
the Alaskan Democratic delegation. They
pruceeied to make merry, and one of tho
Democrats was laid out to sober up, so John

A Patent-F. Y. S., Stockton, Cal. It will
cost you just as much to secure a patent on a
simple article as it would to secure one on a
i complex one so far as the Government fees
are concerned. In ordinary cases the lees of a
lawyer who \%iil prepare official papers, speci
fications and drawings ana attend to the se
curing of the patent will cost about $40 and
the Government fees £35 more. It would be
almost useless to send on the fees to the patent
office and expect the <>fficiai* there to secure
you a patent. They will not do it. for there is
certain work in connection with the prepara
tion ot papsrs that the clerical iorce -will not

story is as follows: ""I heard of Herr Andree's
departure on his balloon voyage on my ar
rival here and remembered that I had noticed
in the White Sea a stranga object, thi nature
of which I could not determine. It could not
be a ship, as it was soft and moved freely. A
dead whale which had become so soft would
have emitted a' bad smell, and moreover only
one or two bins were flying abont the object
in question. I conclude therefore that what
we saw must have been the remains of Herr
Andree's balloon. We noticed it on the morn

latitude and 35 deg. 34 mm. east longitude.'

NATIONAL CONVENTIONS.
How They May he Secured for San
Francisco.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Call— Sib:
Too much cannot be said in isvor of the work
inaugurated at the recent meeting called by
Mayor Phelan by the appointment of a ""con
vention committee"" for the purpose of in
ducing conventions to meet in San Francisco.
1 doubt, however, if even the leaders of that
movement fully understand the vast import
ance of the work they have undertaken and
the extent to which they can push it, pro""
vided the matter is handled in a sufficiently
systematic manner as a petmanent institu
tion among the many organizations for pro
moting the interests of California.
Owing to my experience for a number of
years as an official reporter of convention
proceedings in many cities cf the East and
West, I have seen the great opportunity for
work on behalf of California ln this matter,
and did, in fact, endeavor to start this move
ment directly following the Midwinter Fair
congresses.
A statement was published from one of the
members of the recent meeting that ""a year
in advance was not too soon to beziu work for
a convention/ The fact is that ""a year in ad
vance"" is too late to beein work. For in
stance, suppose we wanted to secure tne Na
tional Electric Light Convention for 1.98. We
cannot, because the mace of mcc.ing iv 1898
nas already been fixed by the convention oi
1897, recently held at Niagara' Falls. Was there
any strong argument made on that floor for
San Francisto? Probable not. Now if we want
that convention ior 1899 the only wav is to
start your work now, ii..v out by correspon
dence the feeling of leading members ana be
iv position to open up *, campaign through
the mails for Sau Francisco some time beiore
tne convention of 1898 meets. * Tnen see that
delegates are tent irom San Francisco who are
powerful speakers, backed up by ail the litera
ture that can be iurnished by your convention
committee and also by all tne local influence
lv the electrical line tnat your convention
can bring to bear here. Ail the electrical In
terests on the Pacific coast will help get that
convention. Tnen see that the strongest pos
sible invitation and argument in behalf ot
California is made on the floor of the 1898
convention, next year, to secure the conven
tion for 1899. We cannot get the 1898 con
vention, because that is already fixed md
there is no other way but this to get the one
lor 1899.
This convention committee should open im
meuiaie correspondence witn the iflicers of
every convention in the Untied butea, of
which there are hundreds, ascertain tne dates
oi their next meetings, and then see that at
the next meetings the campaign is started for
Caiitornia for the foi. owing meeting. When
ever a location has been selected lor 1898. let
us find it out, ami work for '99. If we wait
until '98 to work for '99, we ate too .a.
Again, the committee is working to secure
two or th.cc large conventions which are in
immediate sight, ihat tight is we. l in hand
ty certain members of tne committee. Let
ihem keep v up. but do not let me work of the
whole com mi nee slop there, lor there are
huuuieds of oiher conventions, not so well
known, that can he secured and bring many""
thousands of people here, to say notning of
the tremendous advertising the State would
receive, both ihiou.h the mail campaign ana
the fight fjr Caiitornia on the floor oi every
convention. The advertising we receive '
, would be worth all it cost, even if we failed to I
secure the convention, It could not be ex- '
pected that every convention none after !
would yield, but by going after all, we would
capture many no: otherwise expected, and
the effort would in uo' case be wasted, ow.n»
to the prominence the State would receive
through the aicitaiion for it.
There are a lew large conventions of which
the general public knows. These the commit
tee will start after first, but unless ihat com- '
mittee loons deeply and thoroughly into ihis I
matter they will overlook the hundreds of •
conventions interesting to many thousands of
people, but about which very lew people hear I
except those persons directly interested in th,! !
subject matter of the convention or the par
ticular line of work fostered by that associa
tion.
, The conventions held iv the United States j
cover almost every known field of human en
deavor. No one has a:y idea of tb*;:r number,
or of the vast number of people interested In
them, unless he has made a special study of
the subject. - These people ail take an active
interest in the selection of the city where the
next meeting shall be held. In many of them
prolonged fighia take place on th- Boor, and
lively voting after herring the merits of va
rious locations fully »et torth.
Nowhere does such a fiela exist fcr interest
ing public attention in the merit- of Califor
nia and actually bringing thousands .'. people
to the Stale as .on the fl -or of these conven
tions. But the work most be taken v*. a* a
permanent business undertaking, with a regu
lar organization, and the systematic work
commenced more than a year in advance of
each convention.
When the Trans-Mississippi Congress met at
San Francisco the city o: 8 . Lou;*- determined
to have the following meeting. They sen;
men here to secure it, who linden their
business and they captured the convention.
When it met la St. Louis the city of Portland
wanted the next meeting and lost it by oaiy
one vote. If an intelligent fight had b^en
made by Portland they would nave secured

san francisco call.,['San Francisco'],1897-12-19,"CALIFORNIA AND ITS DEVELOPMENT.
■ fay ALIFORNIA possesses in
a their most favorable form those
1 Phj-sical agencies which Buckle,
V Guyou and other students of
nature have found to most
> powerfully influence the growth
of nations. In climate, in soil,
in food products and in the beauty and
grandeur of physical aspects she
stands unrivaled, while her coast line
and natural facilities for water com
munication cannot be surpassed any
where.
. She possesses, in a marked
degree, those other elements of
• wealth and prosperity coveted by all
• mankind. For the construction of
-.• ships we have iron and timber, and
the raw materials necessary to the
arts and manufactures can be found
neither greater in quantity nor better
'■■ In kind In the most prosperous States.
Granite and sandstone abound, and to
my knowledge the marble columns for
■; the Stockton library could be procured
:"" in but two of the States of the Union,
of which California was one. We have
- also sufficient copper, asphalt, petro
leum and borax to supply the coun
try, and it was California's gold that
saved the nation's credit during the
Civil War. Nowhere else can such
abundant resources be found, and no
other. State or country can rival us in
them.
What California needs is energetic
development. We have done well, but
not enough. With less than 2 per cent
in population this State alone produces
. SO per cent of the country's borax,
nearly 40 per cent of its gold, all its
beet sugar, its raisins and its quick
silver, and in farm productions it
stand, tenth, while in fruit-growing it
has no peer. Our commerce, according
to the last census, was 5 per cent of
; .that of the entire Union, and when the
awakening Orient, with its countless
millions and its material wealth shall
seek the sea, we, with our favorably
located harbors, will outstrip our older
sisters in the carrying trade,
In manufactures, in the working up
of our raw material, we allow our
growth to be crippled by the prefer
ence given to foreign products and our
infant industries to be killed by the
Influx of Eastern prison-made goods.
There is no reason why California
should not be one of the greatest of
States. She has a coast line of twelve
hundred miles, while ihe ocean line
alone, if laid out in the Atlantic sea
board, would expend from New York
City on the north to Charleston on the
south. In her area of 100,000,000 acres
many great States of the East might
be lost. New York, Massachusetts,

HOW TO REACH THE
YUKON GOLD FIELDS
Very important Information for
Those Going to Alaska
Next Spring.
Splendid Inducements Offered by San Fran
cisco as an Outfitting Point— What the
Alaska Trade Committee Is Doing.
In anticipation of the Immense rush
to the gold fields of Alaska in the com
ing spring and in order that the pub
lic might be convinced that the proper
outfitting points for prospectors and
miners is San Francisco, a committee
is now- actively engaged in furnishing
valuable information concerning
Alaska and subjects pertaining there
to to every applicant. The committee
is known as the Alaska Trade Com
mittee, and is composed of the Mer
chants' Association, Board of Trade
and Chamber of Commerce of this city,
which organizations nave combined
for this special purpose.
The reliability and integrity of the
gentlemen composing the committee
are well known, and residents of any
State in the Union who desire advice:""
as to how to go to Alaska, when to
go, what to take, where to get it and
what it will cost may be certain of re
ceiving gratuitously the best possible
Information relative to those import
ant subjects.
It is generally conceded that the
quickest route to the Yukon is via San
Francisco. This city has direct con
nection by regular steamship lines
with St. Michael at the mouth of the
Yukon River. The open sea passage
Is the shortest and safest route. The
Japanese current and the prevailing
trade winds expedite the northern
movement of steamers. At St. Mich
ael passengers and freight are trans
ferred to river boats. Travelers reach
the Yukon River and its tributary
gold-laden streams without having to
pay any Canadian duties until Circle
City is reached. Thus far there has
been no duty collected on individual
miners' outfits. San Francisco also
maintains regular and direct com
munication by steamship lines with
Juneau, Dyea, Skaguay and other
Alaskan ports, and by making San
Franc their starting point travel
ers will not be stranded en route wait
ing for overcrowded steamers.
The question of securing proper out
fits is one which the committee has to
answer more frequently than any
other. The? invariable answer is to
secure outfits in San Francisco. The
supplies of our merchants are practi
cally inexhaustible. Those of smaller
towns on several occasions during the
rush last summer were utterly deplet
ed. Merchants in those towns found
themselves unable to fill large orders
and were forced to telegraph to San
Francisco for shipments of goods by
express. In consequence prices in
those places were advanced beyond
reason, and the persons who had been
led to believe they could buy on short
notice in those towns as cheaply as in
San Francisco were compelled to pay
exorbitant prices for goods on the eve
of sailing. V. .
The .hotel accommodations of San
Francisco are ample, and no matter
how great the rush may be every
visitor is certain of finding accommo
dations suited to every condition in
dropped upon the map of California,
would simply blot out a few of her
counties, and to cover the map it would
take the addition of Delaware, Ver
mont, New Hampshire, New Jersey
and Rhode Island.
It cannot be doubted that the ad-
Vent of what we are pleased to call
a new era has aroused our citizens to
the knowledge of the wonderful re
sources of the State and to better
directed action. We have grown, it is
true, but we have forgotten while
growing to sufficiently advertise that
fact to the world and so create mar
kets for our products. How easily
this may be done is shown by the in
crease ln the demand for our dried
fruit brought about by the Hamburg
exhibit this year. Had an appropri
ation been made for the Paris Exposi
tion our Hamburg exhibit could have
been kept Intact in Europe, a daily ad
vertisement of the State. It is to be
hoped that the next Legislature will
provide for this great exposition and
also for the maintenance abroad of a
State agency.
This movement has resulted already
in the material progress of the State,
the repeal of many bad and the enact
ment of some good laws. The favoring
of foreign products by our State insti
tutions is now prohibited. Other laws
have found their place in the statutes
lessening the cost of constructing and
reducing that of maintaining certain
State institutions and placing them un
der civil service rule; still others pro
hibiting those adulterations which,
among other things, forced from the
market our own pure productions. In
addition many State expenses have been
reduced, the State being placed on a
steady cash basis for the flrst time in
ten years, the amount annually taken
from the people as taxes being dimin
ished and a greater reduction rendered
probable, notwithstanding the estab
lishment during recent years of many
new State institutions and the increase
of our population.-
The good thus accomplished does
not more than equal the beneficial re
sults of private enterprise and benevo
lence. The construction by our citi
zens, under the leadership of Claus
Spreckels, of a railroad down the great
San Joaquin Valley, connecting with
tide water at Stockton, has by compe
tition given our shippers a rate for
transportation impossible to secure
through commissions and courts, and
in my opinion settled— so far as Cali
fornia is concerned— vexed ""trans
portation"" question.
Soon, by extensions, we shall possess
?reater facilities and lower rates, and
when the national Government meets
life. The smaller towns on the coast
are unable to insure the proper care of
visitors In this respect, an important
point which no Klondike-bound trav
eler can afford to ignore.
As regards prices it may be said
that the keen competition In the lines
of goods most required by the miners
prevents any combination and conse
quent rise in the price of commodities.
Prices will be found to be at bedrock.
San Francisco manufacturers and
merchants, with half a century of ex
perience, are thoroughly familiar with
the needs of miners. No other city in
the world has had the same facilities
for gaining this knowledge. San Fran
cisco merchants study and understand
the packing of goods for every climate,
especially for the Arctic. San Fran
cisco is the distributing center for the
whole Western coast for all California
flour, woolen goods, clothing, blan
kets, canned goods, dried evaporated
vegetables and fruit, beans and agri
cultural products which must form a
large portion of the miner's stock of
supplies. Many of the best goods in
these lines which are sold in other
cities are shipped from the great
warehouses of San Francisco. Con
densed foods of all kinds are obtain
able here. Furs, which form a very
important, if not essential, item in a
miner's outfit, are abundant and cheap,
as San Francisco is the headquarters
of the two largest Alaska fur compa
nies in the world and the center for all
the whaling fleets.
The bureau of information of the
trade committee is located at the
ferry depot, where a staff of compe
tent, courteous and painstaking men
daily furnish full and reliable infor
mation on any subject relating to the
gold fields, the means of reaching
them, routes, arrivals and departures
of vessels, fares, freights, duties, out
fits, prices, locations, American and
Canadian mining laws, regulations,
etc. Those who desire to obtain direct
Information from men who have re
cently prospected in the Klondike
country, in the Copper River region
or in the Yukon Valley, will find in at
tendance at the bureau ""Yukon pio
neers,"" prepared to give them correct
and trustworthy ideas, derived from
years of experience. These men can
state the necessary (requirements,
modes of travel, ho-.*.* to pack animals,
ways of' living, distances from given
points of the various discoveries, how
locations are made, etc.
An interesting and instructive fea
ture of the bureau is a complete ex
hibit of wearing apparel, food-stuffs,
tents, instruments, boats, sleds, tools,
stoves, pack saddles, medicines and
everything else deemed necessary
either for the journey or for work at
the miner's claim. This exhibit is an
object lesson. It saves a man asking
a thousand questions, enabling him at
a glance to see what he really wants
and what he can afford to do without.

our State In the further Improvement
of our rivers we can truly hail not only
a new era but a great one.
The results of this awakening also
appear in the enlargement of our ap
propriations for our higher education,
and, through the generosity of Mrs.
I'hebe Hearst, our State University is
should fail to see this exhibit and
know what is essential to the trip. It
should be borne in mind that fully
nrne-tenths of the proper requirements
are either grown or manufactured in
California, and that it is to the in
terest of those who are Klondike
bound to buy in the original market,
thus saving the cost of freight and the
middleman's profits.
The Importance of the committee's
work to California in the way of in
ducing newcomers to settle here can
not be overestimated. While the com
mittee was formed to further the in-
terests of the Alaska miner, prospector
and tourist, it is convinced that many
who start for that country will event
ually locate in this more desirable one.
Opportunities are here offered to all
classes of miners and prospectors,
from the man who comes with pick
and shovel to the millionaire who
brings millions to invest. The placer
mines and the large gravel deposits
found in several sections of the State
are yielding large returns to Investors,
and new ones are continually being
discovered.

MT. TAMALPAIS
SCENIC RAILWAY
Wonderful Scenes From the
Top of That Moun-
tain.
A Luxurious, Inexpensive and En
chanting Ride to the Summit
Open to Everyone.
The completion of the scenic railway
to the top of grand old Mount Tamal
pais, ""the mighty sentinel of the sea,""
a few months ago was an incident of
decided Importance to San Francisco
and its environs. The difficulty of
reaching the summit had for years
prevented strangers as well as others
from witnessing therefrom one of the
most sublime scenes it is vouchsafed
to man to view. With the completion
of the scenic railway, however, the op
portunity for reaching the summit is
ever present, and the patronage ac- j
corded to the new line Is an emphatic
attestation of the wisdom of its pro
jectors.
The trip from this city to the
summit of Mount Tamalpal3 is in
two sections— one from San Francisco
to Mill Valley and the other from the
valley to the summit. The time occu
pied in making the trip is about two
hours. Taking the train at Sausallto.
the tourist is carried to Mill Valley, a
distance of five miles, where connec
tion with the trains of the Mill Valley
and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway
is had. The road at once enters the
romantic and heavily wooded canyon
of Bllthedale. Crossing the canyon,
the road swings out upon the broad,
open flank of the mountain.- The as
cent to the summit then begins, and as
time passes the beauties of the scene
are gradually unfolded. Arriving at
""Double Bowknot,"" the grand old
Pacific springs to view in the west.
The panorama now expands, holding
the attention as by a spell. Mountains
appear to the view in the east and
north; the shimmering waters of the
bay catch the eye; scenes of unsur
passed beauty and grand sublimity
spring up at every point of the com
pass. Presently the train reaches the
tavern, 210 feet below the summit of
nually, and doing it without complaint.
THE STATE'S GROWTH.
The growth of the State during re
sent years is shown by statistics. In
1880 our population was but 900,000.
Now it is 1,500,000. In 1574 California
produced but 220 pounds of raisins.
In twenty years the production has in
the mountain. After a rest of a few
minutes at this charming place the
trip is resumed, and in a few
minutes the tourist views from a
height of 2592 feet a scene compared
with which the vision of Mirza fades
into insignificance. To the westward
one sees sixty-five miles of ocean, the
line of which extends from Point San
Pedro in the south to Point Reyes in
the north. San Francisco, to the
south, appears to be a city of toy
houses. The bay, with its noble
islands and myriad shipping, presents
a scene never to be forgotten. Far to
the east one sees Mount Diablo and
the snow-crowned summits of the
Sierras, 155 miles away. The strangest
sight of all, perhaps, Is the white sea of
fog which frequently blots out the bay,
cities and towns, its surface rolling
in long undulations. Beneath this sea
of vapor a busy world struggles, while
above all Is peace and sunshine. The
most wonderful spectacle to be viewed
from the summit is the sunrise in a
sea of red, orange and amber lights,
which end in a splendid sunburst of
yellow. These are a few of the noble
sights which travelers over the scenic
line are privileged to enjoy.
Tickets can be bought of Thomas
Cook & Son, 621 Market street, good
for special day and train. Parties
purchasing tickets at this address may
be sure of transportation on Sundays
and holidays. Tickets for the round
trip from San Francisco to Mill Valley

are 40 cents and for the round trip
from Mill Valley to the summit 51;
children under 12 half fare.

trail of light he leaves behind him

The tree falls in the forest; but In the
lapse of ages 'it is turned into coal, and

bones.""
Man's Hope for Immortality: Sir
Humphrey Davy.
The caterpillar, on being converted
into an inert fecaly mass, does not ap
creased to 74,000,000 pounds, more than
one pound to every man, woman and
child in these United States. During
the same period the dried fruit of the
State had increased from 548,227 pounds
to over 82,000,000 pounds. In less than
twenty years-following 1876 our citrus
fruits increased from 2,000,000 pounds
to more than 160,000,000 pounds, and our
deciduous fruits during twenty-two
years increasing from 1,832,310 pounds
to 159,905,000 pounds.
Since 1572 our canned goods have
increased from less than 200.000
pounds to more than 55,000,000 pounds.
In beet sugar, dairy produce and in
lumber the increase has been equally
great, / our dairy products in 1896
amounted to $12,331,067. In ISB6 we
made only 600 tons of sugar, while the
product in 1895 amounted to 30,000 tons.
And figures furnished by Mr. John D.
Spreckels show that next year the
amount will exceed the consumption
of this State, being estimated at 90,000
tons. At this rate we will soon be able
to supply the Union. In 1889 our gold
production amounted to but $11,212,913.
In 1896 it was $17,181,562. In 1897 $19,
--500,000, and soon will exceed the prod
uct of the earlier days. In 1875 our
total production of wine amounted to
but 4,000,000 gallons, while in 1897 26,
--000,000 gallons were . produced. This
year our growing vines— wine, raisin
and covered 157,000 acres, while
the value of our viticultural interests is
$85,000,000.
We have growing 452,252 acres in
fruit and nut trees, as against 224,152
In 1892. If prices have not been re
munerative it is because we have not
paid proper attention to creating a
market for our products abroad. We'
have expended large sums in studying
and caring for their production, a
very small fraction of which spent in
market - making would have kept
prices up and insured prosperity to
the St-Ue— a. State that has in one year
produced fruit enough to load a train
of cars 500 miles in length, each car
holdi.ig ten tons, and which has spent
in the fifteen years following 1880 on
viticultural and horticultural commis
sions nearly $425,000.
Now that the expense of supporting
these commissions has been stopped
$20,000 annually should be expended in
maintaining exhibits in Europe and
the East which would be of great
benefit in extending our markets and
establishing remunerative prices for
our products.
Notwithstanding our fine climate
and our abundant productions we can
not expect to reduce generally the cost
of our many institutions unless we
abolish needless ones and receive as
pear to be fitting itself for an Inhab
itant of the air, a*»d can have no con
sciousness of the brilliancy of its fu
ture being. We are masters of the
earth, but perhaps we are the slaves
of some great and unknown being. The
fly that we crush with our finger or
feed with our viands has no knowledge
of man and no consciousness of his
superiority. We suppose that we are
acquainted with matter and all Its ele
ments; yet we cannot even guess at the
cause of electricity or explain the laws
of the formation of stones that fall
from meteors. There may be beings,
thinking beings, near or surrounding
us, which we do not perceive, which we
cannot imagine. We know very little;
but, in my opinion, we know enough to'
hope for the immortality, the individ
ual immorality, of the better part of
man.
The Certainty of Immortality: Caleb
D. Bradlee.
. I believe that there has been a tele
phonic, telegraphic and electric influ
ence ever since the days of Adam to
the present hour by which all past his
tory is present life, and every nation
seemingly dead Is living again in Asia,
Africa, Europe and America, so that
the races of to-day are but the great
grandchildren of the races of the past,
and you and I have something in our
bones and blood of Egypt, Assyria,
Babylonia, Judea, Phoenicia, India
and Persia, so that nations never real
ly die, but are changed, transmitted,
reorganized, improved, by marriage, by
birth, by intermingling of races, by
time, by the grace of God, so that, in a
certain philosophical sense, I am not
only an American but a Roman, a Gre
cian, a Persian, a part of everybody
and everything that ever has been, and
a part, by transmission, century after
century, of everybody and everything
that ever will be; and thus there is an
everlasting unity of flesh, and the
unity of God and the unity of human
ity are great and mighty and twin
realities. Do not forget the prayer of
Jesus— that those that were his might
be one with him, as he was one with
God. Once more, nature changes all
the time. Yes; but nature never dies.
Do those leaves that you tread under
your feet on an October or a November
day perish? Are they annihilated? Is
their work done and is our farewell to
them a finality? Oh, no! They will
go into the hungry earth, and through
many changes at last will fall Into
your hands in the shape of a luscious
peach or rosy apple or juicy pear, or
else as a violet or rosebud or Japonica
inmates such persons only as are ad
mitted to similar institutions else
where, all of which I took occasion to
point out in my biennial message, as
also that comparisons by per capita
were idle, the elements of climate,
production and methods varying so
much. It being evident that no great
saving can be made except by methods
which Legislatures will not adopt, we
should consider how else to equalize
taxation.
Some claim this would be done by
exempting entirely money and bonds
and railroads and streetcar lines and
all kinds of personal property, and
buildings and improvements, placing
the entire burden on farming and other
lands. I will frankly confess I have
not studied this theory, which has as
its advocates some of our ablest
statesmen. My belief, of long stand
ing, is that the true theory of State
taxation consists in imposing on in
comes,"" by a graduated scale, a proper
tax, so that while exempting a suffi
cient amount for maintenance, the per
sons with the greater incomes and
hence those most protected by laws,
should proportionately bear the heav
iest burdens. As was* said in my first
biennial message:
""The burden of taxation so easily
falls upon the material and tangible
things, the real and personal property
of a community, that the- tendency is to
levy upon such property-holding class
an unjust share of taxation. Another
numerous class of our people, in addi
tion to such property, and almost ex
clusive of it, are granted and enjoy
under our laws an extremely valuable
possession in the nature of corporate
rights, privileges and immunities. Such
corporate advantages are always bene
ficial and often the source of great
profit.
""This class of property it is very dif
ficult to assess or value, and it gene
rally fails to contribute its just share
of revenue for the support of that
Government by the sanction of which
alone it enjoys its existence. Our
constitution-makers undoubtedly con
templated that this class should be
taxed for the benefit of the State.""
* * * This would ""impose upon all
corporations in this State doing busi
ness for profit a graduated income tax,
so .adjusted that they be required to
pay only such sums as are strictly
just and fair, and that equal justice
be done among them.""
This desirable result can only fol
low when the people unite In sending
to the Legislature representatives
pledged to the enactment of laws
relieving us from unequal taxation
and placing the burden where it
belongs.
will bless your eyes, cheer your heart,
and somehow spiritually say: ""We do
not die, we have never perished; we
are blessing the world forever and
ever; and, like you, O mortals, 'we are
immortal.""
BATTLE OF
BIG SNAKES.
I once witnessed a fight between two
snakes which lasted three full hours,
through the whole of which a reverend
friend and I, two grave and gray and
sober men, stood spellbound.
It was in Australia and the fall of
the year. My friend and I were return
ing from a tour which had carried us
far into the ""bush."" We were walking
through a clearing when the unmis
takable rattle of a snake arrested us,
and in a few minutes we saw the be
ginning of an encounter between two
deadly enemies— a black snake and a
rattler. War to the death is their un
alterable law from generation to gen
eration. The black snake is (as we
know it there) much smaller than the
rattle, but he is a terribly formidable
foe, and, as science is superior to
mere size and strength, he generally
comes out of the fray the victor.
On this occasion we did not see the
black snake until he had leaped on
the rattler's throat, nor could we make
out how he had got so near without
being seen. That power of stealthy,
rapid movement gives the black fellow
an Immense advantage. He got his
grip on the throat, and there he held
on like grim death. With a fury that
was terrible the rattler wriggled, and
shook, and reared, and rolled, and
writhed. He leaped Into the air,
twisted and tossed himself about,
threw his assailant heavily down on
the ground, rolled on him and over
him, but all in vain. Blacky simply
stuck. Thus for about an hour and a
half the life and death game was kept
up without a minute's intermission
and without much sign of weakening
on either side. Then the rattler's
strength began, or seemed, to give way,
and all of a sudden he colled himself
up and lay still, as if to die.
Blacky was not to be tricked. Down
he lay by the side of his prostrate
victim, but with h.s teeth still fir n.y
set in the now torn ani crumpled
throat. Then, after a quiet interval,
the one-sided truce having come to an
end, or the ruse having failed, the rat
tler suddenly sprang up and resumed
the unequal struggle on which his life
depended; but all in vain. We began
to see in him new signs of falling, but,
notwithstanding increasing weakness,
he struggled on, round after round,
until, nearly three hours after the be
ginning of the fight, the poor rattler
gave up the contest and lay quiet, and
in about ten minutes after the mute
surrender yielded up the ghost. But
even then blacky still hung on, and it
was not until the corpse began to stiff
en that he for the first time withdrew
the nails which three hours before had
been driven into the gullet of the vic
tim. Then, with all possible staidness
and straightforwardness, the hero pre
pared for the celebration of his victory.
He began by stretching! and straight
ening out the lifeless body, smoothing
out very crease and, every wrin
kle. He seemed to have assumed the
office of undertaker. Next we saw that
he was licking the . body from end to
end. ' This he continued for ten min
utes or more. Having done this blacky
rose, shook himself, and he took up
his position at the head of his victim.
Imagine our surprise, when we saw
him open his wide mouth . to its ut
most capacity and take into it the
whole/ head of the defunct rattler.
Then he gulped and swallowed; then
another rest, another gulp, another
swallow, until the end of him was
reached. H. D. 3,

THE CLOSE OF THE BUSINESS YEAR
THE YEAR just closed is an admirable illustra
tion of the benefits resulting from a wisely
framed protective tariff. The first half was
dull and profitless, and there was a growing cry that
the Republican party had failed to keep its promises
of good times; but during the latter half business
was larger than ever before in the nation's history.
The exports greatly exceeded the imports, showing
that the country sold more than it bought. Mills
started up on all sides, the wages of operators were
increased in many localities, railroad earnings showed
a pronounced increase over the preceding year, and
the leading industries, such as woolen goods, iron
and steel, boots and shoes, etc., enjoyed a demand
never equaled in previous years. As for the wheat
trade, it was phenomenal, the exports being enor
mous and the price very profitable. The shipments
of merchandise to foreign ports during the first eleven
months of the year exceeded those for the same
period in 1896 by $86,000,000, and for 1895 by $242,
000.000. This showing ought to satisfy any reasona
ble man of the benefits of a wise tariff.
But apparently the zenith has not yet been reached.
Shrewd observers predict a still larger trade in 1898.
All indications point in that direction. Dealers in
many lines say that stocks in jobbing and retail hands
are small and buyers are even now nibbling at the
markets in a way that presages activity after the new
year gets well going. There has been no pro
nounced decline in prices, and most commodities are
more than holding their own in this respect. Wheat
keeps up, which means a good deal, not only to the
farmer, but to the whole country; and, in fact, al
most the entire line of farm products are selling at
remunerative figures.
While it is thus seen that trade throughout the
country is on a satisfactory basis a glance at the
state of business on this coast will show that it is
not behind the re?t of the nation. The wheat crop
. was large in this State, but in Oregon and Washing
ton it was phenomenal; and in all three States the
prices were so good that the wheat growers found
themselves in clover again. Many of them not only
paid up old liabilities, but carried over a surplus,
something they have not done for some years back.
Hay, which is so closely allied to wheat that it fol
lows that cereal up and down, has been selling better
than for a number of seasons and bids fair to sell
well this year. The demand for farming and min
ing implements ""has been exceptionally good, and
from, present indications will continue so. The lum
ber trade, too, which was in the dumps a long time,
has recently become more active at an advance in
prices, which, while not sharp enough to inconveni
ence the consumer, meant a good deal to the pro
ducer, and owner of timber land. Ship-building,
particularly the construction of small craft, has re
ceived a remarkable stimulus, in which the demand
for tonnage for the Alaskan trade"" has been no incon
siderable factor. The tremendous business in wool
last spring and summer is still so fresh in the minds
of all that it needs no comment beyond that, that
when buyers are so eager for wool that they buy it
on the sheep's back they want it pretty badly. Yet
millions of pounds were purchased in this manner.
The cattle raiser, too, came in for his share of the
profit in the rise in beef and the aGvance in hides
and leather. During the latter part of the summer
the provision trade was so active that the packers
were put to their trumps to fill their orders, and the
wholesalers reported that they never had seen such
a business before, not even in the palmy old days
which the forty-niners talk about.
And so it has gone, all down the list. Everybody
has done well. The farmer has emerged from his
long eclipse and has money to spend once more.
The merchant again feels the satisfaction of the
tradesman when goods go out of his store about as
fast as they come in. The capitalist has no fear
that with the exercise of ordinary caution in putting
out his funds his interest will not be forthcoming in
due season. The wage-worker has less difficulty in find
ing employment, and when he gets it it is more per
manent. When times are brisk more men are needed,
and here is where the workingman is benefited by a
healthy state of trade, to say nothing of the better
wages he is likely to receive.
One of the best signs of prosperity at the moment
is the fine condition of the savings banks of the State.
There are fifty-six of these banks and their resources
on November 30 were in round numbers $148,100,000,
against $142,400,000 on the same datb In 1896. This
shows a gain for last year of $5,700,000.
Taken all in ail 1897 was not a bad year, but 1898
bids fair to make an even better record.
John Wanamaker says his daughter is not to marry
the brother of the Khedive. As the Wanamaker
family is not only civilized, but decent, his word will
be accepted without question.
If Durrant refuses to receive clergymen who de
cline to express belief in his innocence, there is a
probability that little of his remaining time will be
dftyotcd to receiving spiritual advice.
FLOURISHING CALIFORNIA.
GOLDEN, bountiful and splendid was the show
ing made for California in the annual review of
the State published by the Chronicle yesterday.
The statistics of the net results of our productive and
commercial industries are of a nature to confirm the
optimist in his hopes and confound the pessimist in
his despondency. They effectually attest the vigor
of the business energies of the commonwealth and
prove that even under existing conditions Califor
rian-. are rapidly carrying their State to the foremost
place in the Union.
Tiie fact that so much has been accomplished when
each man works for himself alone and when discords
pi avail in the ranks of almost every trade and pro
fession is the surest proof of what can be achieved
when the people work together, and the energies of
the city and the interior are combined for the general
good. The success attained in the construction of
the Valley Road and the benefits flowing from it are
object lessons in the value of co-operation. That
le<-?on has been learned. The intelligent people of
the city are now ready to unite for the upbuilding of
flit State, and when our contemporary publishes its
annual next year, it will have an even better array
ot statistics to show the progress of the State.
The review of the year made by the Chronicle
serves to emphasize the importance of a fuller and
mote elaborate treatment of our mining and allied
industries. This will be done in the grand Golden
Jubilee edition The Call is now preparing. In that
edition will be given the most complete and thorough
account of the mines and mining industry of this
section of the Union that has ever been published,
it is to appear January 23, and will be an attractive
and interesting feature of the Jubilee and the mining
exposition. It will thus complete what may be called
the holiday journalism of the year, and in the wide
f.cld it is designed to occupy will be by far the most
notable production of the season.
INCREASING REVENUES.
CONGRESSMAN DINGLEY makes a perti
nent and gratifying contribution to the sub
jects of New Year congratulations by pointing
cut in a clear and impressive manner the gratifying
it suits obtained from the revenue features of the new
tariff. The monthly treasury reports have made
known in a general way the increasing returns from
oustom duties, but we arc indebted to Mr. Dingley
for the most authoritative and definite statement of
the conclusions to be drawn from them.
In the first place it is noted that the revenues de
rived from the tariff have increased with each month
of its operation.
The revenue was only $19,000,000 In August ($7,
coo.ooo from customs, in consequence of the large
importations between March 1 and July 24 in antici
pation of the new tariff). It rose to $20,000,000 in
September ($8,000,000 from customs), to $24,000,000
in October ($9,750,000 from customs), to $25.
000,000 ($9,750,000 from customs) in the short
month of November, and now rises to nearly $28,
000,000 in December ($11,500,000 from customs).
Another important feature of the statement is the
lecord showing the increase of revenues for Decem
ber over those of the corresponding period of the
years of the Democratic tariff. The receipts this
year, excluding the amount received from the rail
road sale, were $26,i95-.000, leaving a surplus to the
Government of over $1,736,000. The receipts for
December, 1894, were $22,000,000. Those for De
cember, 1895, were only about $20,000,000, while in
December, 1896, they were even less.
Good as have been the results of the operation of
the tariff in the past there is every assurance that
those of the future will be better. The large impor
tation of foreign goods under the Democratic low
tariff early in the spring forestalled the coming of the
protective tariff, and as a consequence it has not yet
been fairly tested. As these goods are consumed
new importations will be required and there will he
a corresponding increase of revenues.
Taking all things into consideration, Mr. Dingley
estimates that the revenue derived under the new
tariff from this time until the close of the fiscal year
will exceed the expenditures. In other words, we
have reached the end of the period of deficit. From
this time on the income of the Government will be
equal to its aeeds. There is even an assurance of a
surp!us sufficient to pay off the Democratic deficit
and wipe that blot from the books of the national
treasury.
THE POSTAL REFORM BILL.
THE persons and corporations profiting by the
abuses of the existing postal regulations are
showing no little activity in mustering an op
position to the proposed reform urged by Congress
man Loud. Their organs in various parts of the
Union are incessantly misrepresenting the reform bill,
and where they do not openly denounce it they
endeavor to excite objection to it by innuendo.
Among the strongest opponents of reform are the
publishers of trashy novels and books more worth
less or more vicious still, and the publishers of so
called newspapers who circulate thousands of copies
of advertising circulars under the? pretense that
they are sample copies of legitimate newspapers.
Both of these classes of publishers arc injurious to
legitimate trade. There is no reason why the pub
lisher of a book on ""The Fistic Prowess of Pompa
dour Tom,"" or a treatise on ""How to Be a Pirate or
a Yellow Journalist in Three Easy Lessons,"" should
have the privilege 'of circulating them at the expense
of the Government while the publisher of a standard
work by a reputable author has to pay heavy postage.
Nor is there any reason why any person or corpora
tion should be permitted to circulate advertisements
at less than cost.
It is true, The Call will lose something by the adop
tion of the proposed amendment prohibiting the
sending of sample copies as second-class mail mat
ter. The Call has recently issued a grand edition
of 350,000 copies and is soon to issue another large
special edition. It is an advantage to have these
papers admitted to the mails at second-class rates.
Nevertheless The Call recognizes the justice of the
objection to such practices and heartily advocates the
reform.
The Call does not seel: its profit at the expense of
the taxpayers, nor does it admit the right of any
other corporation, institution or person to do so.
The Loud bill is honest, it is economical, it is just.
Ir is imperatively needed to put our postal affairs on
a basis that gives equal rights to all and special privi
leges to none. The measure should be enacted at
this session of Congress, and the friends of the people
should be resolute in urging it upon their Representa
tives in that body.
Had the public been consulted in the matter, it
would have suggested several additions to local ferry
service more necessary than ""rigid ecunomy."" In
this particular department of transit the lack of econ
omy had not been noted.
THE SA^T FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JAXUARY 3, 1898.
NOW FOR WORK
THE HOLIDAYS are over. The compliments
of the season have been passed to and fro, and
all the frolics duly enjoyed. Now we return
to business. To-day we begin in earnest the work
of the new year. The opportunities for improving
our conditions are many. It depends upon ourselves
how we will profit by them.
First and foremost we must make preparations for
the Golden Jubilee and the mining exposition. What
is to be done for these enterprises must be done at
once. The shortness of the time allowed for the
work does not admit of delay. Contributions for
the Jubilee parade should be made liberally and made
this week. As the parade is to serve as an intro
duction to the exposition all citizens should take a
pride in contributing what they can to make it a
pageant truly representative of the triumph accom
plished by California in the first fifty years following
the discovery of her golden treasures.
Along with the work performed for the Jubilee and
the exposition must be that carried on for the pur
pose of bringing to San Francisco the Alaskan out
fitting trade. This work has been well begun, and
is well advanced, but should be pushed forward. The
trade resulting from the rush for the Yukon gold
fields is to be the most important commercial boom
known to the Pacific Coast for many years, and it will
bt our own fault if we do not reap a rich and perma
nent profit from it.
The conditions of the State are of a nature to
encourage enterprise and business activity among its
people. The record of the fifty years since the dis
covery of gold has been one of the industrial won
ders of the age. Though one of the youngest of the
sisterhood of States, California is already first in the
production of gold, raisins, prunes, borax, beans,
oranges, wine and fruits. It is second in the pro
duction of nuts, wheat, lumber, barley, hops and
honey. Its soil is the most prolific and its climate
the most agreeable in the Union.
All the achievements of the past, however, have
hardly more than prospected the resources of the
State. Despite the number of articles of necessity
or luxury in the production of which we lead the
Union, California is virtually an undeveloped coun
try. There remain in every section of the com
monwealth as good opportunities for capital and
labor as any that have yielded fortunes to energy and
thrift in the years gone by. To exploit these as far
as possible is the duty of the time. Let us begin the
work with self-confidence and mutual harmony. The
year begins as a season of promise and will end as
cne of glorious realization if we make the right use
of our advantages and opportunities.
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA.
RUSSIA'S steadfast advance to a position
of dominant power on the Asiatic coast of the
Pacific is rapidly bringing her face to face with
the United States. The two nations whose develop
ment has been the most formidable factor of inter
national politics for the past century and whose
friendship has been one of the remarkable features
of the age, are at last to confront one another on a
scene where there is likely to be a conflict of interest,
for both desire trade with China, and the probable
outcome of the situation is one that will be sure to
engage the thoughts of statesmen in every part of
the world.
The old prophecy attributed to Napoleon that in
the coming century the world would be either Repub
lican or Cossack has been often recalled. All the cir
cumstances attending the history and progress of the
two nations tend to increase the impressiveness of
the prediction, and to encourage belief in a fulfillment
almost literal.
The reorganization of Russia by Peter the Great
in the early part of the eighteenth century was in the
latter part followed by the erection of the American
colonies of England as an independent nation. Thus
the two powers began their political career almost
ar the same time. Their remoteness did not long
keep them from exerting great influence on European
affairs. Both took an important part in the deter
mination of events during the Napoleonic wars, and
since that period both have grown so great they
have almost passed beyond rivalry on the part of any
other nation.
In the course of progressive development the re
public outstripped the empire. We reached the Pa
cific coast while Russia was still confined to the wild
steppes of Central Asia. We constructed our trans
continental railway before she even dreamed of one.
Slowly but surely, however, the giant despotism toiled
after the swift democracy, and now Russia has not
only a strong position on the Pacific, but is con
structing a railway which will connect it so closely
with other portions of the country as to make it one
of the most important features of the empire.
The present crisis may not produce a war, and
probably will not. When this is settled, however,
another crisis will come. The national life of China
seems exhausted, but the commercial and industrial
life of the Chinese people has such wonderful possi
bilities that all the progressive nations of the earth
are eager to gain advantages there for their trade.
In such a condition of affairs one crisis will be set
tled only to make way for another. Sooner or later
the law of the survival of the fittest will do its work
and the strongest will win. Who can doubt that the
strongest will be Russia?
When the period of Russian supremacy in China
comes we will have to negotiate our interests in the
Orient with the Russians. Then will come the test of
our friendship with that country. Then will it be de
cided whether the republic and despotism can agree
to divide the world between them on amicable terms,
01 whether they will grapple in an irrepressible con
flict and fulfill the Napoleonic prediction that the
world of the future shall belong to one of them alone.
So many curious things happen at San Quentin that
the mere circumstance of a convict's sending out a
prescription calling for a quart of alcohol might not
attract much attention. Doubtless, however, there
are penal institutions in which a prisoner is not ex
pected to diagnose his own ailments, nor write the
prescription therefor. The odd feature of this case
is that the paper should have been written in Greek
characters. Naturally the prison officials could not
read it, and their child-like trustfulness in letting it
pass adds an interest to the incident.
Many a habitue of Barbary Coast will learn with
pain that 200 kegs of American beer were recently
dumped into the harbor at Honolulu. There is a
degree of wastefulness shocking even to the Weary
Willies.
A policeman who staggers along his beat under a
burden of whisky is more in need of retirement than
is the sober policeman who walks straight despite a
burden of years.
Blanco could save much trouble by packing his
autonomy scheme in a handsatchel and taking him
self and it back to Spain,
IT WOULD MEAN THE ADMISSION OF A SLAVE STATE
New York Post.
It is very significant that the labor organizations of the country
are throwing their influence against the annexation of Hawaii. An
earnest protest against the scheme was recently mads by this element
in California, and since then the American Federation of Labor has
shown that workingmen throughout the land sympathize in this respect
with those on the Pacific Coast. The federation adopted a resolution
disapproving of annexation, on the ground that it ""would be tanta
mount to the admission of a slave State, the representatives of which
would necessarily work and vote for the enslavement of labor in gen
eral""; urging the Senate to reject the treaty, and take such other steps
as may be necessary to maintain amicable relations with Hawai, and
providing that the executive council shall present these views to Con
gress, and, if necessary, to the President. Such a pronunciamento
from such a source will have much weight with politicians who have
no pronounced Convictions on the subject, especially with the members
of the House, if the treaty shall fail and the scheme shall be pushed
by joint resolution. A representative who sees no particular reason for
annexing Hawaii, anyway, will easily be persuaded to oppose the project
if ""organized labor"" in his district is ready to fight a Congressman
who favors the creation of what it considers likely to be ""a slave State.""
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS.
BY A MODEST CRITIC.
This being the season of the year when
men are prone to open their hearts for a
moment or two I will open mine. The
Examiner is the direct beneficiary— the
public the incidental. The paper referred
to has been good enough to offer unasked
time and again advice as to how a news
paper, In order to succeed, should be con
ducted. The advice has usually been di
rected to the editorial management, and
most of it has been but a cover for per
sonal spleen. If the Examiner will watch
this paper for a year or two I promise It
that it will be taught all it has attempted
to teach, but this being Yuletlde I will
save it at least for a few months of the
pain caused by inattention to the neces
sity of correct behavior. Having seen
the evolution of a successful newspaper
or two I have had one lesson clearly
taught me. This: In order to win and
keep the respect of its readers every
journal must be sincere in comment. The
Examiner is rarely that. To aver black
to be white one day and to Insist that it.
is of sable hue the next is inconsistent
as well as_ being insincere. ""What follows
is from trie editorial columns of that pa
per on Wednesday last:
""The integrity of the Monroe doctrine,
with tha maintenance of our vantage
point of consistency on that issue, is
worth a good deal more to this country
than its Interest In China's trade. The
Monroe doctrine is something that by
Implication works both ways, and the
I'nited States cannot afford to surrender
any part of It by dipping into Europe's
embroilment over the affairs of the far
East.""
The Examiner has advocated day In
and day out Interference with the Gov
ernment of the Hawaiian people by the
Hawaiian people, seeing in that polio
no deletion of the Monroe doctrine, but
in intervention in a squabble over China
and her affairs it discerns the complete
obliteration of this, our national policy.
A doctrine that is held by the nation
must be firmly held, no matter whether
it applies to affairs 3000 miles away or
10,000. When it is asserted that it will
destroy the Monroe doctrine to engage in
the Chinese embroilment, and that this
Stygian project ■will not be accomplished
if we assume the right to control Ha
waiian affairs, either insincerity or alack
of reasoning power is shown. In the
Examiner's case it smacks of both.
It has been asserted by a prominent
controversialist that education for the
masses is a breeder of discontent. I dif
fer. This time is chosen for the expres
sion of the difference of opinion because
educators have, during the week past,
occupied a deal of public attention. Ed
ucation is almost entirely the training
of mmd — cultivation of brain power. It
imparts knowledge, too, doubtless. but the
increasing of the power to reason is
actually its chief value. The educated
man (all other faculties being equal) will
accomplish more in any given time than
can the uneducated. This applies to bak
ers and to fakers, as well as to tailors and
to sailors; In truth to the world. No
schemes yet devised, except actual war
fare with another nation, have proved
more prejudicial to the interests of na
tions than have strikes and labor riots,
and strikes and kindred follies are
caused principally by lack of education.
The average laborer is easily led astray
by the ""walking delegate"" (whose only
mission is to produce discontent), by an
assurance that ""the rich are getting
richer and the poor are getting poorer
every day."" The inaccuracy of this
statement he would readily see were his
mind well trained. But he sees it not,
so he is induced to strike, and not only
does he suffer for his folly but the whole
community Is compelled to. Is it not
wiße then to do what we can to prevent
suffering and waate of natural resources?
These are the two fruits of strikes and
labor riots Invariably.
An able collaborator suggests the
hanging of attorneys who attempt to
prevent the prompt execution of Justice.
If he will include inciters to ""labor
troubles,"" when he next stints some peo
ple ""like a white hot brand,"" he will
find one more mark on the credit side
of his account when he faces the record-
Ing angel. But I happen to think hang
ing far too good for attorneys who act
in this way. If the Bar Association
would see that they are denied the right
to practice they would probably starve,
and might perhaps find a living death.
Then the punishment would lit the crime.
It is scarcely to be expected that W.
W. Foote would so promptly verify the
statement that it was good for California
that he was not permitted by the Legis
lature to go to the Senate. Some, ttoe
ago it was stated that he had retired
permanently from his cheerful habit of
defending criminals, but now I am
pained to note that he makes his appear
ance in the most disgusting case ever
presented to any court. That Durrant
could permit his mother's and his Bisters
decency to be Impugned in an attempt
to save his precious neck is evidence
enough that he is unfit to live, and that
Mr. Foote could appear for him in such
an action— for that is what he virtually
did— must be shocking to each acquaint
ance of his who knows what honor is. '
General Ballaine of ""Washington has,
we are told by London dispatches, writ
ten to a prominent Journal of that city
voicing his annoyance at W« T. Stead's
book, ""Satan's Invisible World."" This
warrior's letter is described as extraor
dinary, and It must be, for he avers that
the ""real American of the West hates
New York as much as he hates London.""
The ""real American of the West"" hates
no one without cause, and we have no
reason to hate the people of New York.
We joy occasionally because the part of
the Union in which we happen to live
has advantages which other States have
not, but that breeds not hate 'mongst
sensible men. Does this ""general"" wish
to divide the country longitudinally? An
attempt was once made to divide it
laterally and a repetition of that horror
no sane man desires.
Why any one on this continent should
care an atom as to what Mr. W. T. Stead
chooses to say of It passeth- comprehen
sion. He ia not a litterateur, nor is he a
competent critic. Failing, when editing
the Pall Mall Gazette, to command and
hold general attention by the excellence
of hi» legitimate work, he descended to
sensation, and be has never cot out of
that glitter since. It was pointed out to
him when he first began his downward
course that if he had information fit for
police ears he should take it to the po
lice. What he alleged he had discovered
was no news. And he knew it too.
Mr. W. T. Stead is neither a keen ob
server, a clear thinker nor an able
writer, and each of these a competent
critic must be. His opinions when talk
ing of America and her institutions are
worth as much consideration as would
be a volume by his satanic Majesty on
heaven. It Is of record that the Prince
of Darkness was cast out of Paradise
and it is a fact that this Stead per
son has been shown that he has not
got brains enough to make his living in
America. That is true, and it is becauso
he is ""neither fish, nor flesh nor good red
herring"" that he is despised.
THE COAST PRESS.
John H. Delahanty, one of the old-tfme
Journalists of Oakland, has put on the
hirness once again, and is scintillating
through the columns of the Saturday
Press, in the ownership of which he re
places John Bell.
The Randsburg Miner affords striking
evidence of the increasing prosperity of
that camp by enlarging from four to six
pages, in order to accommodate a rapidly
growing patronage and at the same
time do justice to passing events in the
rich Mojave gold fields. ""The develop
ment of our mineral resources,"" says the
Miner, ""is being pushed forward, and it
is our intention to keep pace with the
onward march in this district.""
Myron Angell, pioneer newspaper man
and historian of San Luis Obispo County,
is the author of a twelve-page pamphlet
entitled ""The Climate and Wealth of San
Luis Obispo County, California."" It con
tains statistical and descriptive matter
showing forth the. advantages of that sec
tion, and is illustrated with views of
Port Harford, the old San L'uis mission
and the most prominent county schools.
It is designed for Eastern renders, nml
should prove of much benefit to the fa
vored region in question.
With the first of the year the Calaveras
Citizen changed hands, L. F. Jones, form
erly of Paso Robles, succeeding H. W« 11.
Penniman as editor and publisher. The
retiring editor remarks, in his farewell
address, that the conviction had been
forced upon him that ""one man cannot
act as real estate agent, photographer,
assayer and surveyor and run a news
paper at one and the same time,"" hence
his relinquishment of the Citizen, which
has certainly improved under his man
agement.
The special edition of the Redlands
Facts is an admirable number In every
way. It is called ""Illustrated Redlands.""
and contains a hundred pages, book pa
per, illustrated profusely with photo
gravures. An Idea of the scope of the
work may be obtained from the fact that
the illustrations embrace the portraits of
nearly 200 prominent citizens of the city
and vicinity, over 150 views of residences
and business blocks and some forty mis
cellaneous pictures. It is unquestionably
one of the tinest editions of the kind -ever
produced in California, and is a superb
advertisement for Redlands.
The thirty-six page edition of the
Seattle Press-Times, issued December IS,
is a number highly creditable to that en
terprising publication. It gives a large
amount of valuable Information concern-
Ing the State of Washington, and will be
of service to Seattle in making known
abroad her advantages as a commercial
city. 'A special object of the paper is to
attract thither as much as possible of
the Klondike trade. It is interesting and
pleasing to note the Press-Times' decla
ration to the effect that its circulation has
increased 100 per cent under its present
management and that the paper is to-day
paying satisfactory dividends and enjoy
ing a degree of prosperity unexampled
in its career hitherto.

Two new vessels In the British navy
met with accidents on the same day last
month, which, although not very serious,
indicate that mishaps are not confined to
the United States navy alone. The Arro
gant, while about to leave tha dock basin
at Devonport to start for her thirty
hours' coal-consumption trial, was driven
by tho high wind against the dock en
trance and damaged her propeller. The

launched February 28. 18%, and completed
September 9, 188?. The estimated cost
of $5,000,000 was exceeded by 5456.485 28,
owing to the rise in prices of certain
articles, and the cost of bringing the ship
out to Japan involved an expenditure of
over $100,000. which is included in the total
cost. The Fuji, a sister ship, is shortly
expected to arrive from England. The

tion of fifty-six months, against the
Yashima's thirty-three months. The de
lay in the Indiana was chiefly due to the
failure to furnish the armor and guns
at the expected time.

The Seminole Indian Scare Is Practi
cally Over
EARLBORO,I.T.,Jan 14,-Excitement
ls still Intense here over the recent burn
ing at the stake of two Seminole Indians
(fid the subsequent fear of the Indian
uprising. Here public sentiment has
favored the lynchers; at Wewoka, the
;apltal of the Seminole Nation, the sym
pathy is all the other way, for it is be
ieved that the lynchers tortured and
iillcd at least one innocent man.
United States Commissioner Walter
Jones is holding court at Wewoka and
:he deputies at the court are busy issuing
mbpeneas and warrants in an endeavor
:o bring the lynchers to justice.
An eye-witness of the hanging and
mrnlng of the Indians has volunteered
lis testimony. As no attempt was made
ty the lynchers to hide their Identity, it
8 probable that the leaders will be ar
ested by the United States authorities
?hey can only be tried on the charge
if kidnaping and taking the murderers
iy force from the Seminole Nation. The
dlling of the Indians comes under Okla
loma jurisdiction.
The Indians are sullen. White men
vho have lived with them for years state
hat a general outbreak will not occur,
ut that there is great danger that the
ndians will avenge themselves by klll
ig, one by one, the leaders of the mob.
THE SCARE OVER
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.—Adjutant-
General Tireck has received the follow-,
Ing telegram from General Brooke, at
Chicago, dated last night:
""Major Eskridge telegraphs from
Earlsboro, O. T., that all ls quiet there.
Both sides have been excited and threat
ening. There is no hostile gathering of
Seminoles. None is probable and the
whole thing was a grand scare, which is
all over. In view of this information, I
do not deem it necessary to send any
troops to the border between Oklahoma
and the Seminole nation as contemplat
ed by your telegram of last night.""

MADRID, Jan. 14.—The uneasiness in

ment, but are being quickly quieted

The Carlists and Weylerites expected

The Carlists and Weylerites are

SAILING ORDERS ISSUED
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.—Orders for
sailing from Hamplon roads of the At
lantic squadron have been made public.
These orders are made by Admiral Sic
ard, and are issued in identical form to
the commanders of the various ships
making up the squadron. They are
dated at Fort Monroe, January 11, on
board the flagship New York, and begin
as follows:
""Sir: The squadron ls to be prepared
to sail from Hampton roads, weather
and contingent circumstances permit

CUBAN-AMERICAN LEAGUES
NEW YORK, Jan. 14.—The chairman
of the organizing committee of the Cu
ban-American League makes public a
letter from Hannls Taylor, former
United States Minister to Spain, In
which he says:
""In every city in the United States
a Cuban-American League should be
Instantly formed, whose primary pur
pose should be to arouse public opinion
to demand the instant passage of the
HANNIS TAYLOR
Senate's belligerency resolution now
pending in the House of Representa
tives. When the demand ls opposed by
the wornout technical pretext that the
insurgents are not entitled to such
action until they have first established
a complete de facto government, the
answer should be promptly made that
the law of nations demands no such
thing; that the resolution in question
need only recognize the fact that there
Is now ln Cuba a state of war.""
The Cuban-American League has sent
out a circular requesting the Mayor of
every city in the United States and the
Sheriff or ranking officer in every county
to at once appoint a committee ln every
ward ln the city and each township of
the county to organize a local branch of
the Cuban-American League.
REPORTS OF THE RIOT
NEW TORK, Jan. 14.—A dispatch to
the Herald from Madrid says:
The riots which have occurred in Ha
vana have much significance.
An officer, a strong Weylerite, who
was to have been shipped home and who
had been attacked in a newspaper for his
bad conduct, went with some compan
ions and wrecked the office of the paper.
He was immediately joined by large
crowds of the revolutionary element and
they proceeded to wreck another news
paper office, but the mob was stopped by
the police and the officer arrested. He
will be tried by a court-marital.
The crowd increasing, the local volun
teers were called out. The mob then
dispersed with cries of ""Long live Wey
ler,"" ""Down with Blanco, the United
States and autonomy.""
This public demonstration and the ut
terances of the crowd are evidences not
hitherto . given and showing that the
feeilng of the reactionists when probed
ls equally bitter toward the Spanish
government and the United States.
The government version issued ls very
brief. It says that all trouble ls over,
thanks to the loyalty of the volunteers.

of all the papers, having a whole page

PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 14.—General

telegram from the war department In
structing him to postpone the departure
of the relief expedition to Alaska. Ac
cordingly, the contract to ship the ex
pedition from this port on the steamship
Oregon January 23 has been withdrawn.
The pack train is still held at Fort Van

It will go on. The orders effect a tem
porary abandonment of the expedition,
and it la understood they were based on
the recent reports that there will be
no starvation nor suffering in the Yukon
country that the government relief ex
pedition could relieve. Agent Poston
of the Pacific Coast Steamship com
pany states that his company Is glad to
be relieved of the contract to transport
the government pack train to Alaska,
as it has already more business offered
than It ls possible to handle.
The steamer Geo. W. Elder sailed to
night for Skaguay and Dyea, with 350
passengers and a full cargo. Six hun
dred horses and nearly 600 dogs go north
by the Elder.
A STEAMER SURRENDERS
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 14.—The Can
adian steamer Danube of Victoria vol
untarily placed herself in the custody of
the United States authorities today.
Last December the Danube violated
the customs regulations of Alaska. Or
ders were issued to seize her, but she
sailed out of American waters before
seizure could be made.
The Danube wants to enter the Alaska
trade this season, and her owners, with
a view of purging the boat of her of
fense, decided to bring her here and put
her through a seizure process, In order to
block any similar attempt in Alaska.
The United States attorney is preparing
libel service.
FOR YUKON SERVICE
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 14— Six large
harges and three river steamers for serv
ice on the Yukon and its tributaries are
building at the shipyard of P. D. White
law & Son. The boats are for the Alaska
Exploration Company, in which the
Rothschilds are largely interested, and
will coat more than $250,000. The boats
will be taken apart and shipped to Un
alaska, where they will be set up and
lowed to the mouth of the Yukon. The
pieces of the nine boats will be stowed
in the hold of the American ship Sln
tran, which will be towed to Dutch Har
bor by the tug Fearless. The distance
to Dutch Harbor is 2030 miles and the
feat of the Fearless, if successfully ac
complished, will break the Pacific Coast
long-distance towing record by almost a
thousand miles.
CANADIAN MINING LAWS
OTTAWA, Ont., Jan. 14.—A commit
tee of the Cabinet has drawn up new
regulations for mining in the Yukon
which make important changes. It is
now stated that the alternate claim reg
ulation has been abandoned and that
the government proposes to reserve al
ternate blocks of ten claims, which, It
is thought, will give miners a better op
portunity to operate. The present in
tention ls to reserve the government
blocks until they are disposed of at pub
lic auction. Another feature of the new
regulations is the abandonment of the
sliding scale of royalties. Instead, an
even royalty of 10 per cent will be ex
acted from all miners.
WHISKY SEIZED
PORT TOWNSEND, Jan. 14.—Cus
toms officers seized 402 quart bottles of
whisky on the steamer City of Seattle
just before she sailed for Alaska. A
small quantity on the City of Topeka
was also found.
CHARTERING TUGBOATS
PORT TOWNSEND, Jan. 14.—John
B. Libby, manager of the Puget Sound
Tug Boat Company, left last night for
San Francisco, where he will endeavor
to charter three tug boats. The in
creased demand for tug boats is due to
the Klondike travel.
TWO MORE STEAMERS
STOCKTON, Jan. 14.—C. M. Hamilton
and C. R. Clow, representing two Chi
cago companies, today let two contracts
to the Jarvls ship yard in this city for
two steamers to be built for the Yukon
river. The steamers are to be built
complete except the upper works, and

One steamer will be 65 feet long, and the
other 62. After being launched they

for St. Michaels. There they will be
launched again from the vessel's deck,

LAWS FOR ALASKA
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.—Attorney-
General McKenna today submitted to
the senate a special report made by the
committee to revise and codify the crim
inal and penal laws of the United States
concerning the criminal and penal laws
relating to Alaska; also a code of crim
inal procedure for that district ln the
form of a bill which accompanied the
report of the committee. In its report
the commission says that as no organi
zation of the territory of Alaska, the
District of Columbia and Indian Terri
tory has been authorized ln congress
which contemplates local self-govern
ment, It Is required to codify the crim
inal and penal laws peculiarly appli
cable to these territories. The criminal
laws of the United States will form the
body of the code which the commission
is to prepare. The commission points
out that by \irtue of the act providing
a civil government of Alaska, the laws
of Oregon become laws of the United
States. The commission suggests that
if the bill which It reports be enacted
into a law it will furnish a complete
penal code for Alaska.
SMITH APOLOGIZED
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 14.—Collector
Milne is in receipt of a letter from
Skaguay, in which it ls alleged that J.
H. Smith, United States commissioner
for Dyea and Skaguay, claims a strip of
land three miles down from the head of
Lake Bennett, which is near the boun
dary line, as It is defined by the United
States, and which would give the
United States control of the territory
from the coast to the lakes. Commis
sioner Smith, the letter alleges, has or
dered all locators of lots to have them
recorded with him. A party of Ameri
cans, the writer says, followed up the
commissioner's declaration by hoisting
the American flag Just below the police
barracks, where the Union Jack was
flying. The police demanded an ex
planation, and after some parleying the
flag was hauled down and an apology
tendered.
RUCKER'S REPORT
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 14.—The re
port of Major L. H. Ruckerof the fourth
cavalry, who was sent to Dyea by the
war department to ascertain the condi
tion of affairs ln the Yukon, was re
ceived by General Merriam today at
Vancouver barracks. From his inter
views with those who have come out
from Dawson recently and from his ob
servations of the Chilkoot and White
passes, Major Rucker conncludes:
First —That while there ls a shortage
of stores in the Yukon basin, a state of
famine does not at present exist, nor is
it likely to exist ln the immediate fu
ture.
Second—That a large expedition, with
quantities of supplies hauled on sledges
by horses or reindeer, could not proceed
down the Yukon further than the foot of
Lake Labarge, 400 miles from Dawson.
Third —That reindeer on such an ex
pedition are no more esrviceable than
are mules or horses.
Fourth —That If government assist
ance ia conspicuously needed in the Yu
kon it would be when the stores now in
the hands of the people are exhausted,
which Is not likely, from all he can learn,
to be earlier than April or May.
He therefore recommends that if the
snow locomotive company which has a
contract wjth the government, does not
convey the relief into the Yukon during
February, the government pack trains
with sledges should carry them across
Chilkoot pass and on the lakes and
rivers to the foot of Lake Labarge dur
ing the month of March, and there await
the breaking up of Ice In the Yukon.
The supplies could then be taken to
Dawson in boats.
The Chicago Snow and Ice Transpor
tation company, which has a contract
with the government to haul the relief
expedition supplies from Dyea to Daw
son, notified General Merrlam today
that they would be unable to start their
snow train Into the Interior earlier than
the middle of February. The contract
which the company has with the gov
ernment allows that length of time In
which to start the expedition. General
Merrlam has, therefore, extended the
time of starting the expedition to some
time ln February, I

WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.—After the
transaction of some routine busi
ness In the senate today, Mr. Hoar,
of Massachusetts, presented the fol
lowing resolution, proposing an amend
ment to the Constitution:
""Resolved, That the following article
be proposed to the Legislatures of the
several States as an amendment to the
Constitution of the United States:
""The term of office of President and ot
the fifty-sixth Congress shall continue)
until the 30th day of April, in the year
1899, at noon. The Senators whose ex
isting term would otherwise expire om
the 4th day of March, ln the year 1899, or
thereafter, shall continue ln office until
noon of the 30th day of April, succeed
ing such expiration, and the 30th day o£
April, at noon, shall thereafter be sub
stituted for the 4th of March as the
commencement and termination Of of
ficial terms of President, Vice-President,
Senators and Representatives in Con
gress.""
The resolution was referred to tha
Committee on Privileges and Elections.
A clerical error ln the resolution
placed the date when the change should
take place ln 1899, when It was Senator
Hoar's intention that the date should
have been 1901, which would extend Mr.
McKinley's term for a little more than
a month, instead of shortening It, as
would have been the result ln the resolu
tion as first Introduced, If it had be
come a law. Mr. Hoar afterward
changed the resolution ln accordance
with his Intention.
Mr. Quay, of Pennsylvania, offered the
following resolution, which was refer
red to the Committee on Indian Affairs:
""Resolved, That the Secretaiy of the
Interior shall be, and hereby Is, In
structed to Investigate the facts attend
ing the recent alleged atrocious burn
ing to death of two Seminole Indians by
a mob in Oklahoma Territory, and make
a report thereon to Congress.
""That the sura of $25,000, or so much
thereof as may be necessary, is hereby
appropriated out of any money in the
Treasury not otherwise, appropriated,
for the investigation, apprehension and
punishment of the guilty persons, to be
expended under the direction of the
Secretary of the Interior.""
Mr. Lodge, of Massachusetts, ottered
a resolution, which was agreed to, call
ing upon the Secretary of Agriculture to
supply the Senate with information as
to the amount of sugar Imported into
the United States, the amount of beet
sugar produced in the United States;
with what sugar, imported or domestic,
the beet sugar comes into competition,
and what effect the Hawaiian sugar has

Mr. Tillman, of South Carolina, an
nounced that on account of the illness
of his colleague, Mr. McLaurln, he
would ask that the eulogies upon the
late Senator Joseph A. Earle, which
were to have been presented today, be
postponed. The request wa!s granted.
IN EXECUTIVE SESSION
Almost the entire four hours of tho,
executive session of the senate today
were devoted to the indirect considera
tion of the nomination of Hon. Joseph
McKenna, now attorney general, to be
associate Justice of the supreme court.
The discussion was the result of an ef
fort on the part of Senator Allen of
Nebraska to secure a postponement for
two weeks. In the end a compromise
was reached, deferring consideration
until a week from today, on the condi
tion that the Nebraska senator should
allow a vote to be taken on that date.
The Hawaiian treaty was not touched
upon during the session.
The debase upon McKenna's nomina
tlon was precipitated by Senator Hoar,
chairman of the committee on judiciary,
who called up the nomination in accord
ance with his notice of yesterday and
asked for Immediate action. In doing
this Mr. Hoar spoke fully on the opposi
tion to McKenna, saying that the judic
iary committee had investigated most
of the charges made and had reached
the conclusion that they were without
foundation. He said that the greater
number of charges had been made by
the members of the American Protective
association, and as they had been
founded solely upon the fact that Mr.
McKenna was a Catholic in religion,
they had not been deemed worthy of
serious consideration. Mr. Hoar dwelt
at some length upon these points, ex
coriating any man who would attempt
to inject a question of religion Into a
controversy over a man's fitness for
office. He said that surh an effort was
entirely un-American and unpatriotic,
and should not for a moment receh'e the
consideration of fair-minded men.
Senator White of California also
spoke of the effort of the A. P. A. to In
terfere with the course of the senate
in (riving attention to a question, the
determination of which should depend
on considerations of fitness and justice
as between man and man, rather than
upon an appeal to bigotry, prejudice
and a false claim of patriotism. He
spoke of the A. P. A.s as fools, who
could not be properly characterized In
the senate. He had no patience, be said.",double sheet wenty ftfth year m usement angeles theater ojt j everybody bayb itb greatest uoaay toniohr chance watkeivs laugh r laugh m sfiu ger j stand y iourm scan tale

of these old soldiers was displayed the
Scott medal.
Following the cavalry came the men
of the Golden Gate Life Saving Station,
which is under the direction of Major
T. J. Blakeney. There were sixteen men
In the uniform of the service, under
command of Captain James Hodgson,
who is in charge of that particular sta
tion. The men marched four abreast
and after them came a cart drawn by
two horses, tandem, on which was a
box containing the life lines, bombs,
fakir's boxes, and then another vehicle
drawn by two horses tandem on Which
there was a life boat, and after that
there was another vehicle drawn by
four horses, on which was a large surf
boat.
A number of carriages brought up

these rode General John Bidwell and
the following named members of the

The second division, under Marshal
John F. Plnkham, formed at Steuart
and Market streets promptly at 10:30
o'clock, and within ten minutes the
column was in the line of march
It was led by a float truthfully rep
resenting ""The Aborigines.""
As of yore the aborigines led the
Pioneers.
Marshal Pinkham and aids, E. Mc-
Geary. Gart Bouton and James Gree

musicians who had the honor of es
corting through the streets those who
had toiled in behalf of family and State

As the parade formed, the Santa

among those in line being President

Murgotten and Miss Dixon. Then the
companions of James W. Marshall
rolled into view.
As the venerable Pioneers passed
down Montgomery street a cheer went
forth from the throats of a seething.

went echoing on its way to be but re-

that now come those who made the

from the tardiness ingrafted in the
younger sons, but they waited with pa
tience, though eager for the fray. Thoa.

came in order. They numbered ISO
strong, and followed in their turn.
Major Meyers, Sam Gardner, W. H.
Shelley and Mike Slater were among
the mounted Pioneers in the parade.
■The mining division. 200 strong, then
swung Into line with Division Marshal
T. T. Lane of gallant Calaveras, and
his aids, carrying the line of march. A
float, representing Tuolumne County,
on which miners of early days worked
at gravel rockers, was next In line. The
picturesque Calaveras County Jubilee
band of twenty-six pieces led the
Veteran Guard of California, Lieuten
ant Eugene Wiegand commanding.
\ The band was dressed in the regulation
[miner's garb, with oil lamps on their
hats and trousers tucked in their boots.
Th«y looked like miners, but played
like musicians, for such they are. A
Spanish navigator float was in the line
of march, and a float representing Cal
averas County was one of the features
of the day.
On the platform drawn byfftur horses
a large skull, golden in color, was
erected above a tunnel in which miners
were at work. An inscription. ""The
County of Skulls,"" carrying out the
time-worn legend, was painted on the
banners; $100,000,000 has been taken from
the county, and the banners also be
spoke that fact. The float was made
under the supervision of the Calaveras
County band and W. T,. Hummel,

ANCIENT FIREMEN
ACCOMPANIED BY
OLD-TIME MACHINES.
flartin Van Buren's Engine
Contrasted With the New
Water Tower.
The third division was organized and
ready to move long previous to the Is
suance of the order to advance. When
the clarion notes of the bugle sounded
for the third to join the line of march
it was about 10:40 a. m. The division
rested on Spear street, its right ex
tending to Market, and when the order
came it was the work of only a few
minutes to swing the columns into the
city's main thoroughfare and it then
continued on its scheduled route.
Men in the strength of youth, in the
prime of life and in the gloaming of
human existence: fire-fighting machin
ery with the rust of a hundred years
upon it and again mighty constructions'
of steel, fresh fro-m the painter's brush,
made up the third division. At the
head of the column rode Marshal Colo
nel J. H. Burns. Behind him, in com-
memoration of Balboa, who ages ago
christened the Pacific, when dreary
sand dunes and tangled forests marked
the spot where San Francisco now
stands, a float, ""The Spanish Naviga
tors,"" was drawn along. It was a ship
of clumsy lines and fan-shaped sails,
but a true representation uf the egg
shell craft in which Balboa used to
brave the ocean storm centuries ago.
Then came the young and the aged, the
old and the new.
George C. Bohen, president of the Ex- j
empt Firemen's Association, led his
comrades in the cortege. A long line
of carriages in which the hoary headed
Exempts were seated came next, and
behind the strongest of their lot
marched, dragging along with them the
first and the oldest fire engine on the
Coast. The old engine, a mere toy
when compared with a modern fire
fighter, was manufactured in New York j
in I*2o, and was . subsequently pur
chased by President Martin Van Buren.
I When the gold rush in the latter fordes
I con mended '.he engine, whlcn hac"", low;
since left the possession of President
Van Buren. was hitched behind a yoke
of oxen and brought over the plains
to the land cl the setting sun. It ""as
j c/ist here anl there for a tlni"" 1 . .and fin
! ally found permanent occupation in San j
Fr; nciscn. It was usei for three yean !
by the Extwptfi in their ; - battles with
the flames, but finally, in 1852, a better
etigl:i<? was constructed by tha firemen
and Martin Van Buren's ""toy"" was laid
away forever.
The engine of 1852 followed its pre
decessor and the gray haired men who
drew it along the streets were cheered
and cheered again by the crowds that
lined its route.
The Board of Fire Commissioners,
George T. Bohen, Joseph S. Marshall;
Frank G. Edwards, Colin M. Boyd and
John W. McDonald, and Chief D. T.
Sullivan in carriages were next in line.
Behind them rode a number of Ex
empts, whom age and accident had dis
abled. Modern fire apparatus, consist
ing of Engine No. 2, the machine that
was awarded the first prize at the
""World's Fair at Chicago, hose cart,

master machinist in the fire depart
' ment. The huge machine stood out In
strange contrast beside Martin Van
Buren's ""toy"" that preceded It but a
few yards in the line of march. It Is
built almost entirely of metal; brass,
steel and bronze entering largely in its
construction. It is a mefailic telescope
'■ tower, the inner tube being of brass
1 and twenty feet long, the outer tube of
steel, which can be extended twenty
two feet high. The machine attracted
unusual notice owing to the fact that it
was built entirely in this city and ex
perts say far surpasses any apparatus
imported from the Eastern States.
The veteran volunteer firemen's band
was next in the line of march, and with
its music set the pace for their com.
radea behind. The l?st of the third di
vision was mado up <>f visiting firemen.
Vallejo Hook and Ladder No. 1 were
the proud possessors of an old engine
i built in 1859. This its members drew
proudly along the streets until the
parade was ended and then took their
treasure to the veterans' headquarters,
where it will be zealously guarded until
the days of the Golden Jubilee are past.
NATIVE SONS AND
DAUGHTERS ESCORT
THE JUBILEE QUEEN.
Her Entourage Presents an Im
posing and Inspiring
Spectacle.
The fourth division was composed
principally of Native Sons and Daugh
ters of the Golden West and in point
of numbers and display of brilliant
colors was a veritable kaleidoscope.
They formed in good order and time
on Main street, moving thence into the
main column. The male sections of
this divison were handicapped by the
fact that a great many members were
obliged to turn out with the various
military companies to which they be
long, but they made a splendid show
ing nevertheless and they were re-
ceived all along the line of march with
genuine expressions of hearty admira
tion. Especially was this true of the
fair sex who took part. They were
greeted with salvos of applause, and
ejaculations of ""ohs"" and ""ahs"" along
the entire route.
The Native Sons all wore their re
galia, the yellow sashei. being emblem
atic of past and present officers, the
red for trustees and blue for the mem
bers themselves. All the parlors were
preceded by two beautiful silk flags,
the Bear flag of the California Repub
lic, and the American flag, and in addi
tion by their respective banners, which
in pome cases were packed by hand,
in others rolled along on nickel-plated
bicycle trucks with pneumatic tires,
and still others drawn in more up-to
date style by Shetland ponies.
First came the float representing the
early Missions of California. At the
door of the little chapel sat two aco
lytes dressed in red cassocks and white
surplices, their names being Clyde
Hillings and Raymond Glynn. Then
followed Marshal Edwin L. Head, a
prominent member of Stanford Parlor
and at present school director. He was
mounted on a coal black steed and
wore the regulation yellow sash and
plumed hat. His aids all wore som
breros, and among them Dr. William
Acland H. Oronhyatekha in full Indian
costume. He is a descendant of Joseph
Brant, a full-blood Ifbhawk heredi
tary war chief of the Iroquois Six Na
tions. The other aids were: J. J. Don

C. B. Fenn. W. A. Deane. F. J. Hille

H. L. Mulcreavy, H. Llchtensteln. F. C.

lUley, O. F. Lunge. J. D. Hauser, A. C.
Pintolesi. Joseph D. Cavanaugh, J. L.
Holliday, L. H. Kohn, W. E. Ashmore.
The grand officers were next In car
riages, among them Judge Connolly,
grand president; Frank Mattlson,
grand vice-president; Henry Lunstedt.
grand secretary; Grand Trustees
Fletcher Cutler, Joseph Hawkins and
Joseph Coffey. and Past Presidents
George Clark. Frank H. Dunne, Justice
Garoutte, Thomas Flint and T. Jones.
The first section of this division was
led by Section Marshal L. E. Nonne
mann and his aids Henry Faure and
J. B. Kennan followed by mounted In
dians, who varied the monotony by in
dulging in lusty war whoops (returned
in kind by the onlookers), Mexicans
and mounted miners in costume; the
Independent Rllles (escort). Captain
L. Schneider commanding.
The N. S. G. W. float came next. This
was the ""thirty-first star of the Union,""
and the bright particular star was im
personated by Miss t. Brown.

Parlor, No. 52; Rlncon Parlor. No. 76;
Yerba Buena Parlor, No. 84, and Stan
ford Parlor, No. 76, which turned out a

""California,"" whi«""h was designed and
built by members of the last named
parlor. A very pretty one it was, too.
drawn by four large white horses, each
weighing 1,900 pounds. The predomi
nant color was yellow, and ""California""
was represented by Miss Irene Graves,
her attendants being Pearl Squires and
Josie Hoare. The float also carried the
parlor's banner and a huge stuffed
bear and eagle.
The third section formed in line of I
march under the direction of Marshal j
S. A. White, led by Sequoia band. Miss ;
Mollie Brown and Mrs. Ida Kellenber
ger acted as aids, and the strains of the
music heralded the approach of the
Jubilee Queen, Miss Minnie Klevesahl.
A four- horse carriage followed the
music, in which were seated Mrs. ;
Torres, the oldest Native Daughter in
the State of California, who was born
at the Presidio of San Francisco In 1826.
She was accompanied by her husband,
and cheer after cheer was heartily
given as the carriage passed along the
line of march.
Then Sequoia Parlor No. 160. Preclta
Parlor No. 187. Olympus Parlor and the
Olympus Parlor band, Presidio Parlor
No. 194, Wistaria Parlor No. 127 in car
riages gaily decorated with California
poppies and jubilee flags. Oakland Par
lor No. F>o and Dnnner Parlor No. 162 of
Truckee passed by. A float entitled
""Golden Star of the Union"" followed in
line with the Queen enthroned on Its
spacious platform. The stars and
stripes and the beauty of the Queen
stirred the blood of the onlookers as
nothing more had previously done. Ar
rayed in regal garments, surrounded by
her attendants. Miss Rita McCarthy,
Miss Mabel de Rose. Miss Ruby Cam
eron. Mips Isabel Pommeroy and Miss
Nettie Kapp, the fair Queen occupied
the ambulant throne of a scene not
soon to be forgotten.
The red. white and b!ue mingled with
brighter colors as the float glided along,
and as the Native Daughters from the
various parlors of the city followed in
white riding habits mounted on spirited
chargers, an anxiety was felt as to
which portion of the section would be
most pleasing to the eye. The white
velvet habits with yellow-lined capos
and white fedora hats trimmed with
gold stars and cord lent animation and
color to the already dazzling pir-ture.
At their head r^de Miss Bertha Gar
diner, a little girl, the mascot of the
cavalcade: th"" Miss.-s Anna Brown,
Mary Hurke, A. L. Donaldson, Erma
Lindsay, Laura I?aker, Mattie Farris,
[* MTcDoosaU* Lucy Granger. A. L.
Farren, Nettie Care, L. McComb, L.
Fitzgerald, and Mesdames Charles
Levy, J. C. Fit zpai rick, Esmond and
Ives.
There was much indeed to interest
and entertain in this division and the
Native Sons and Daughters are to be
congratulated on their fine appearance
and the enthusiasm which character
ized them in lending their best efforts
to make their part of the parade an
unqualified success. They were most
orderly and marched with a military
precision not often found among: civil
ians. Some of the parlors turned out
over a hundred men and this is a re
markably good showing.
Especially was there a profusion nf
silken banners and the letters X. s. G.
W., done in golden popples (which is so
much easier to spell and pronounce
than esohscholtzia). was a noticeable
feature, borne as th»y were by two In
dians and t\v.> Mexicans in their char
acteristic costumes. The whole divis
ion was essentially a native production
and without making any invidious
comparisons it was as good as could
be seen in the whole parade.
A feature of note was the three
bands, composed respectively of Golden
Gate. Sequoia and Olympus Parlors,
which discoursed music in splendid
style.

the place assigned for the division to
form in line. The men were in place
at 10:30 o'clock awaiting the order of
the grand marshal for the procession
to move.
At the head- of the division was a
handsome float representing the rais
ing of the flag at Monterey. The de
sign was that of one of the old-fash
ioned houses of early days with a wide
veranda running around. Grouped on
the veranda were a dozen people

guard for divisions 2, 3, 5. 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 14. 15. 16. 17, 18 and 20 of the Ancient

from adjacent towns fell in behind the
Alameda delegation.
At the head of section 3 of the divi
sion was a large float representing one
of the famous round towers of Ireland.
The tower was an Imitation of granite,
and was profusely covered with moss
and Ivy brought from Ireland. At each
of the four corners of the float were
living figures representing Ulster,
MunFter, Connaught and Leinster, the
four provinces of Ireland. The thirty
two counties were represented by
young ladies dressed in white, wearing
green sashes. Seated on the side of a
mountain in the rear of the round
tower was an Irish harpist playing old
time Irish melodies. The sides of the
float were further adorned with hand
some shields, on which were painted
pictures representing some of the Irish
heroes.

MILITARY DISPLAY
OF DISCIPLINED
GERMAN SECTIONS.
Escorted by the Hannoberanner
Verein on Massive Wh ite
Chargers.
The sixth division began forming at
10 o'clock on Beale street. Division
Marshal Rudolph Herold Jr.. with his
aids, quickly directed the various or
ganizations to their proper places in the
division. Owing to the length of the
divisions that preceded theirs the Ger
mans had a wait. Their turn to march
at last arrived, and they swung into
line behind the Irish societies.
A float representing the discovery of
gold headed the division. Miss Florence
Aswell, dressed in the costume of
Eureka, sat on a golden hall, holding
in one hand a shield and in the other a
wand. Her feet rested on scenery de
picting undulating land, and on which
was a roof showing a shaft that had
been sunk.
Division Marshal Rudolph Herold,
accompanied by his aids, A. H. R.
Schmidt and Edward Aigeltinger, fol
lowed immediately after the float. They
wore yellow and white sashes and som
breros, and were mounted on horses
decorated with military trappings.
""Section Marshal Dr. F. P. Muffe and
his aids, Henry M. TVreden, Henry
Wederky, H. Kuhls and Paul Ehren
pfort, rode with the Hannoveranner
Verein. The latter organization made
one of the most striking pictures in the
parade. Mounted on white horses were
over 120 members of the society. Each
wore a white and yellow sash and a
black beaver hat with a silver star at
the side. The company was in command
of Captain J. M. Foge, who was assisted
by Lieutenants August Meyer, Fred
Eggers, Henry Belmer and Richard
Jorgens.
Ritzau's Band of twenty pieces head
ed the San Francisco Schuetzen Verein.
The 120 men who were in the ranks
made a handsome appearance in their
close fitting uniforms and their breasts
covered with medals won at various
shoots. Captain Bohls commanded, and
was assisted by Lieutenants J. F.
Thode, H. Stelling, D. Yon der Mehden
and E. Ibsen.
Next in line were the Red Men's
Schuetzen Company. Green uniforms
and red trimmings composed their dress
and the forty men in the ranks pre
sented a fine military appearance. Cap
tain H. Greib commanded and William
Dressier and M. Dioeckert acted as his
lieutenants. Open carriages in which
veteran members of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein were seated followed.
Ex-Captain J. Wulzen, C. Hilderbrandt,
C. Hadenfeldt. H. F. Maaes, C. Nob

; Lohmann. J. Wierik, A. H. Kunst and
| H. Flathmann.
The carriage bearing A. Rahwyler,
I A. Rtrecker. Philo Jacoby and William
| Ehrenpfort attracted much attention. A
: sign notifying the people that they were
| instrumental In winning for California
I the championship in the great Centen
1 nial shoot at Philadelphia In 1876 gained
i them many cheers. On top of the car
riage was a solid silver cup which they
hold as a trophy.
Other California Schuetzen Club
members in carriages were J. C. Waller,
L. C. Babin. T. J. Carroll, Wm. Nolden,
John Horstmann, Adolph Utschig, D.
Roberts and F. C. Muller.
In a wagon decorated in Jubilee col
ors was Chief Marker H. Liebert and
his two sons. A large transparency
was sh'iwn, on which was painted the
ring, bullseye, man and point targets
which are used by the California
Schuetzen Club.
The second section of the division
was in command of Marshal F. A. De
nlcke, who was accompanied by A.
Dierks and W. Utschig as aids. A
float containing forty pretty young
girls of the San Francisco Turn Ver
eln led the section. It represented Pa
triotism, Gymnastics, Shooting and
Fencing, the different branches taught
by the organization. The girls were
dressed in the uniform used in the
gymnasium. Captain Charles Z. Zim
mer also occupied a Seat on the float.
Ebert's Military Band and the San
Francisco Drum Corps escorted the
San Francisco Turn Verein. First
came the shooting section, and then
forty members of the organization,
dressed in gray suits with red belts,
each man carrying a silver wand. Fif
ty young gymnasts, dressed in the
same costume minus the wands, fol
lowed in their wake, and along the line
of march they gave a splendid exhi
bition in fancy drilling. Professor
Barth, their gymnastic instructor, also
marched. The Turners were com
manded by Captain Attinger and Lieu
tenants Fred Komer and Joseph
Straub.
The division was lengthened by the
Vorwarts Verein and Rchwaben Ver

and led the way for the members of
the Backer Verein.
A. Becker was marshal of the third
section and was assisted by Aids
Thomas Meyer, Charles Loesch, Charles
Rihn. Alfred Hooper and August
Brusse.
* The Verein Eintracht was well rep
! resented by its shooting and turner
i sections and members. Yon der Meh
den's band, discoursing patriotic airs,
led the society on the march.
In the shooting section were fifty
members, dressed In gray uniforms
with green facing. Their fine military
appearance won them many encom
iums. The company was commanded
by Captain F. A. Kuhls. He received
able assistance from Lieutenants Otto
Thiel and E. Jessen. The Turners were
led by George Steffins. A wagon load
ed with yong girl members of the so
ciety, dressed in their gymnasium

little children dressed as their elders
were. Selo's band furnished the music
THE JUBILEE WAS WISE
STOCKTON, Jan. 24.—Govern
or James H. Budd was seen at
his home this afternoon by a Call
representative, and at the men
tion of the celebration in San
Francisco the Governor ex
pressed his deep regrret that he
and Mrs. Budd could not par
ticipate in the festivities of
the day. An attack of his old
enemy, the rheumatism, was re
sponsible for his being deprived
of the pleasure, but he had fol
lowed every detail of the prepar
ations and knew what a great
affair it would be, as San Fran
cisco never did ai.ything by
halves. When asked what
thoughts the day suggested to
him, the Chief Executive handed
the reporter the following ex
pression of his sentiments:
J. D. Spreckels, Proprietor of the
San Francisco Call:
The Jubilee was wise. It com
memorates the discovery which
set in motion those great ener
gies which gave California its
early Statehood and prominence,
and it should mark the begin
ning of a new era when like en
ergies applied to our other and
greater resources will make Cali
fornia one of the greatest and
brightest stars of the Union.
JAMES EL BUDD, Governor.
for marching. Fifty men were in uni
form and nearly 100 of the members
marched without any.
Henkes' band of fourteen pieces led
the way for the Deutscher Krieger
Vereln. The shooting section was rep
resented by thirty-six members in uni
form. The representation from the so
ciety was increased, however, by near
ly the same number wearing the so
ciety's regalia. Captain Wienke com
manded and was assisted by Lieuten
ants Kaiser and Franke.
PRIM TURNOUT OF
THE LEAGUE OF
THE CROSS CADETS.
They Are Led by a Typical
Pioneer Schooner of the
Forty-Nine Days.
One of the greatest features in yes
terday's parade was the float exhibited
by the League of the Cross Cadets.
The showing made by the boys of the
regiment was remarkable, and their
excellent appearance and their su
perior knowledge of military tactica
was shown to especial advantage. No
regiment, not excepting the Regular
Army infantry from the Presidio, made
a better appearance or received more
hearty applause and cheering than the
boys of this one. Along the line of
march from the first time they received
the command to fall into line on Davis
and Market streets until they received
the command to disband they consti
tuted one of the central figures of the
parade.
The regiment was made up of four
battalions of four companies to each
battalion and about seventy to each
company. These four battalions repre
sented the full strength of the League
of the Cross organization of this city
and Oakland, numbering about 1000
| recruits.

fl GOOD SELECTION.
GOVERNOR BUDD being a Democrat, we
could not expect him to appoint a Republi
can to the office of Registrar, and since a
Democrat was to be selected the appointment of ex-
Senator Biggy will be received with approval. The
great mass of citizens whose commendation is worth
having will cordially indorse the selection of the Gov
ernor, and the* general sentiment of the people will be
one of satisfaction and gratification.
The office is one of the most important in our
local government. The duties imposed upon the
Registrar and the trust reposed in him are so great
as to render it imperative that the work should be in
the hands of a man of unassailable integrity and un
wavering honesty and fairness. With a corrupt man,
or even an extreme partisan, in the office it would be
possible for gross offenses to be committed in every
election with comparative impunity, and therefore the
need of a firm, faithful and impartial man in the po
sition is recognized as essential to the right admin
istration of our electoral system.
Mr. Biggy possesses every qualification for the
office. He is an experienced man of business and has
an executive ability of a high order. He has been
tested in office and has shown himself superior to
the dictations of bosses and the temptations of
boodlers. Both in public and in pri%'ate life he has
won the confidence of his fellow citizens by the hon
orable performance of every duty and the faithful ful
fillment of every trust.
Governor Budd is to be congratulated upon hav
ing found so excellent a successor to Registrar Hin
ton, and the public will regard the appointment as
one of the successes of the administration. It assures
us an honest and efficient management of an office of
the highest importance, and it is safe to say that in
the work now before him Mr. Biggy will give new
evidences of his fitness for public service and add to
the esteem in which he is held.
ThjE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS.
AMPLE evidence has been given that the peo
ple of California will have to fight over again
the battle against the school book ring which
resulted in the establishment of a system of State
school books. In ways more or less direct the ad
vocates of abolishing the State system and returning
to that which prevailed in times past have given signs
of an intention to force the fight. The issue will
have to be met and it is important that the people
should prepare for it.
It may be conceded at the outset that the State
system of school books is not wholly satisfactory.
No system of books could be. Almost every teacher
*has his own idea of what should be taught in the
schools and how the teaching should be done. The
book that would appear perfection itself to one would
appear an absurdity to another. Each teacher, there
fore, would like to have the selection of the text
books out of which his pupils are to learn what he
has to teach, and such a right of selection might be
good if it were not for the fact that school books cost
money and few parents are able to change them every
time a teacher is changed.
As a matter of fact the better part of all teaching
comes from the teacher and not from the book. Under
the instruction of a competent master a child could
learn to spell just as well out of the Webster spell
ing book of fifty years ago as out of the most im
proved spelling made easy that has since been put on
the market. For that reason the purchase of school
books is one of the departments of public education
in which economy can be well practiced as a matter
of the highest importance. It is not necessary to
have a new set of text books in primary education
every time a new fad in teaching sweeps across the
country.
It is much easier to see the evils of the system we
have than that of a system we have not. Before we
become so impatient of the State system, however, as
to return to the former method we should recall the
fact that experience with the old system was the
cause of the establishment of the present one. In
States where there are no State school books the
dissatisfaction is as great as it is here, and with much
better cause. The school book ring of the East is one
of the giant evils of the republic. It is a corrupting
force in politics and in the schools of the first mag
nitude. We are fortunate to be rid of it, and will
rue the day if for slight discontents we abolish our
State system and return to the domination of the ring.
When robbery of an express car is committed
the public is left to guess what the value of the booty
is, and while its conjectures may be wild, it is never
deluded into the belief that the sole loss consisted of
a bundle of twine and the express messenger's lunch.
The waher who is in charge of the police because
he refuses to support his family ought to find in the
circumstance a tip of considerable value.
THE WATER FRONT SCANDfIU
WE present to-day, in summary form, the water
front scandal, for which there is somewhere
serious and perhaps penal responsibility.
For years the administration of the harbor by Com
missioners has furnished scandals and been charac
terized by corruptions of the most serious nature.
Members of the commission have, indeed, suffered
penal consequences, as have their agents and em
ployes.
With such a record one would suppose that the
Board of Harbor Commissioners would be admon
ished that the property and the revenues under their
control present such favorable opportunities for in
direction and dishonesty that they would be moved to
the greatest care and would never surrender those
scruples that are an ever present element in the hon
est exercise of their authority. There are before them
the honorable examples of Commissioners like Irwin
and McCoppin; whose highly scrupulous and intelli
gent management of the water front added honors to
those which they wore so worthily before they en
tered upon these duties.
After reading the record which we publish to-day
we think that no one will conclude that the members
of the commission who are responsible for the loot
ing of the appropriation for fhe ferry building or
those who have constituted that body for the last
few years have found leisure to bask in the light of
these illustrious predecessors in the same office. In
deed it would seem that basking in any kind of light
is not their favorite form of repose.
They have succeeded in erecting a ferry building
so thickly veneered with frauds that if they were
•risible in concrete form the building would be written
all over with them as thickly as the words ""one dol
lar"" on an old Indiana red dog bank note.
If any part of it ha? been spared, from the vent
hole of a pipe to the time ball above the tower, it
should be recorded and a tablet set to commemorate
the oversight. So open and patent is it all that the
sewer openings on the front smell like cologne in
comparison, and the teredoes and limnoria take sec
ond place as ravagers of the State's property. It is
no pleasure for us to point these things out nor to
expose the misfeasance of any one in office. But the
duty of exposure is accepted as inexorable and per
formed with regret. The further pursuit of the mat
ter lies with those who are charged with the penal
purging of high places to cleanse them of corrup
tion. If these things go on the face of the tower
clock will blush so that it will need no illumination
at night, and its hands will be the only ones around
the building that have not been held behind the back.
THE PRIMARY LAW DECISION.
THE decision of the Supreme Court declaring
the Stratton primary election law to be unconsti
tutional will occasion little or no regret among
non-political citizens. The experiment established by
the statute was one which the practical politicians were
quite anxious to try, but there was no popular de
sire for government primaries nor general opinion
that through them- the people would be enabled to
secure better government. Indeed, on the contrary,
there is every reason to believe that the Stratton law
was a device of the political bosses to check the
operation of the official ballot act and by strengthen
ing party organizations restore the old system of cut
and-dried tickets which the people may either vote
or not vote at all.
We are among those who believe in party respon
sibility and party government. We think that after
the Australian ballot has run its course and the un
thinking multitude has had ample opportunity to de
monstrate that in electing ""good fellows"" to office
they are mostly successful in selecting incompetent
officials there will be a return to the old method of
embodying political conventions and conferring upon
them the power to nominate party tickets and for
mulate party politics. Some of the best government
the State and city have ever had has been produced by
party responsibility. In fact, until the political boss
appeared upon the scene with his following of plug
uglies and criminals party government was a success.
Until this malignant individual has been disposed of
we think no device for strengthening the political
machine should be encouraged.
At present the system of independent voting es
tablished by the Australian ballot is rapidly retiring
the corrupt political bosses from view. People no
longer regard party labels nor party machines. A
nomination by a political convention has no greater
significance than that a body of citizens calling
themselves Democrats, Republicans, Taxpayers or
something else have indorsed the aspirant for poli
cal favors for an office. The moment the course of
events demonstrates that such an indorsement mean's
nothing more than this, that moment politics will be
come a science of vote-getting and the present science
of stuffing primaries and packing conventions will be
abolished.
At some time, perhaps, the Stratton primary law —
clumsy and impracticable though it was — might be
considered a step in the right direction. Its purpose
was to dignify parties and strengthen their indorse
ments. But the day has not yet arrived for the en
forcement of such a law. Had the Supreme Court
declared the statute valid there is no doubt that it
would have damaged party organization. There
would have been an unseemly struggle by the bosses
to get control of the Republican and Democratic ma
chines of this city, a loud protest on the part of the
press and the people and the entire theory of the
law would have been discredited. The evils certain
to flow from the independent system of voting now
in vogue have not become sufficiently conspicuous to
justify such a statute. When that time comes it will
be in order to inaugurate a government primary
system.
In the meantime it is well that Senator Stratton
cultivates a feeling of hostility to the constitution and
writes legislative bills with skyrocket sticks. Were
he once to read the organic law we might have elec
toral reform forced upon us long before it is due.
Before an alliance between England and the United
States can assume any more definite form than that
expressed in casual observation, it will be necessary
for the mother country to make that overgrown kid
of hers up in the Northwest behave.
The proposition to give Patrol Driver Cashel a po
sition on the police force is a good one. There is not
only reason to believe he would be a faithful officer,
but he might serve as an example to other officers too
prone to $print.
In papers published yesterday afternoon the find
ings of the Maine Board of Inquiry were announced
for probably the tenth time. When the findings have
been revealed they will be announced some more.
Perhaps Spain's boast of being prepared for war
means that she has a lot of white flags ready to run
up at short notice.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 26, 1898.
' VAIN TRICKS IN HAWAII.
AFTER the frank exposition of the Dole idea
of government in his organ, the Advertiser,
one is prepared to properly weigh and meas
ure the propositions coming from Hawaii and in
tended to affect annexation. There is pending in the
Legislature at Honolulu a measure affecting contract
labor. This has been urged by Dole's representatives
at Washington as a proposition to abolish such labor
and is used as an argument for annexation. An ex
amination of the proposed bill shows that it does not
abolish contract labor at all. It merely abolishes the
penal clause in labor contracts. The contract labor
law of the United States, passed in 1864, had no penal
clause. Its liens were not upon the person, but upon
the property of the contract laborer. That law (see
Brightly's Digest, vol. 2, 1857-65, page 148) pro
vided: ""Section 2 — All contracts that shall be made
by emigants to the United States in foreign* coun
tries in conformity to regulations that may be estab
lished by the Commissioner of Immigration, whereby
emigrants shall pledge the wages of their labor for
a term not exceeding twelve months to repay the
expense of their emigration, shallbe held valid in law
and may be enforced in the courts of the United
States, of of the several States and Territories; and
such advances, if so stipulated in the contract, and
the contract be recorded in the Recorder's office
where the emigrant shall settle, shall operate as a
lien upon any land thereafter acquired by the emi
grant, whether under the homestead law when the
title is consummated or on property otherwise ac
quired, until liquidated by the emigrant.""
That was our contract law which became so offen
sive that it was repealed upon the demand of our
labor organizations. It made the contract a first
lien upon the laborer's wages for twelve months, and
upon his real property forever until liquidated. The
difference between this and the Hawaiian contract
labor is that the latter instead has a penal clause
enforceable against the person instead of the prop
erty of the contract laborer. The withdrawal of this
penal clause leaves the statute ju?t as offensive as our
own and with every feature which made it so ob
noxious that no one dared resist its utter repeal.
Again, the repeal of this penal clause has not
passed. It is proposed as a blind by the crafty island
politicians, who brazenly quote what we all understand
to be the odium of our politics as the avowed rule
of action in theirs.
If the penal clause in their labor contract law is
wrong, it is wrong regardless of its effect upon the
fortunes of annexation. -If it is right, its rightfulness
is not measurable by its relation to annexation. The
men who now parade as a virtue the proposition for
its repeal have had the power to abolish it ever since
1893, but they have let it stand and have taken the
benefit of it.
If our Congress defeat annexation this penal clause
will not be repealed. The MacchiavelHs of the oli
garchy will reveal their true character by continuing
and enforcing it.
These things teach and exhort. They illuminate
Dole's remark that ""we expect the United States will
give us special laws by which we can get labor."" If
annexed they expect to exert their peculiar craft in
violation of our labor laws or in getting special and
unequal privileges.
Existing conditions on the islands expose the
hypocrisy of holding out hope to white labor of an
outlet there. The highest wagfcs paid to field hands
are $12 50 per month, and it is proposed to reduce
this to $10. The Portuguese are disquieted by this,
for they and many of tTie natives are now on the
verge of starvation for the first time in the history of
the country. Dole's government is the author of
these distresses, and the signs of disintegration
among its supporter^ are on the increase. The sham
republic will totter and fall, to be replaced by a real
republic in which the people will have a voice and
the power to protect themselves against starvation
by the use of the ballot.
WARNINGS TO KLONDIKERS.
WRECK after wreck has occurred to give warn
ing to the adventurous that if they expect to
reach the Alaskan ports in safety they must
exercise more than ordinary care in the selection of
the ship on which they are to make the passage. The
rush to the northern gold fields has been so large
that the demand for transportation has led the un
scrupulous to press almost any kind of old hulk intp
service to carry passengers, and there is danger
ahead for all who take ship without close scrutiny
into the nature of the craft they are to embark upon.
While the men who outfit the coffin ships for pas
senger service are to be condemned for the offense,
those who engage passage on them, are not wholly
free from blame. There is no law to prevent such
ships from plying in the coast trade, but a man who
exercises reasonable care can easily find out whether
any ship starting from this port is of that character.
There are abundant sources of information ready at
h?nd for all who have sense enough to make in
quiries, and those who neglect to seek information of
such vital importance are themselves to a large extent
responsible for whatever may befall them on the
voyage.
In one respect the most important lesson taught
by the wreck of the Almy is that of individual re
sponsibility in matters of this kind. It is most
important because it is the one which is
most timely. It will require a long period
of time to procure from Congress the legis
lation necessary to prevent the outfitting of
coffin ships, but the importance of personal care can
be learned and practiced at once. The men and
women who are going north should begin at once to
rely upon themselves to guard against the dangers
of the venture in which they are going to embark.
The leap begins when they take ship, and they must
look before they take it.
Great as is the rush for Alaska, there is no reason
why any one starting from San Francisco need take
any risk with coffin ships. The coast transportation
facilities of the city are large and are being rapidly
increased. There is every reason to believe that by
the time the Yukon opens for navigation the means
of transportation will be ample for the demand, and
the season when the river will be open is now so near
that persons desiring to reach Dawson will be able
to make the trip just about as quickly by waiting for
the river steamers as by going over the passes and
making a long journey by the lakes.
The moral of the situation is plain. The Alaskan
movement is an adventure where prudence is the
better part of valor. The wary will go in safety
where thoff; of reckless daring will rush upon dis
aster. In due time the outfitting of coffin ships will
be made a penal offense, but for the present those
who go north must rely upon their own brains and
look cut for themselves.
Senator Stewart might be in better business than
attempting to haul chestnuts out of the fire for Hun
tington, but he would not be apt to be.

schooner Water Witch, and as is custom
ary- at these sessions of the old tars, there
was much discussion upon the leading
topics of the day. In consequence, the
patriotism of the gathering led to the in
terchange of opinions as to what was the
cause of the Maine disaster. During the
conversation one of those present inti
mated that he would like to be a diver,
declaring that it was a soft thing with
plenty of money for easy work. This
brought forth a few words from Captain
Bogus, a learned and practical seaman,
who, to illustrate that the lot of a diver
is not a happy one, said:
""The average person who glances over
the accounts of the investigation of the
Maine disaster probably thinks little or
nothing of the divers engaged in this
work. He does not know of the dangers
to which these men are constantly ex
posed, even, in the calmest waters. There
is no work which requires such a strong,
vigorous constitution as is necessary to
the diver. Not only must his muscles be
like iron, but his heart and lungs must be
in faultless condition or he will be unable
to stand the strain of living for even a
few moments in deep water. The diver
carries with him on every trip eighty
pounds at least. The suit he wears is
heavy and oppressive. The boots alone,
made of thick lr-ather, with leaden soles,
weigh twenty pounds each and the hel
met, with its Ingenious arrangement of
air pipes and valves, adds forty pounds.""
Captain Bogus is a man who knows
what he talks about, so it did not take
him long to change the mind of the
would-be diver, who frankly admitted
that perhaps the diver did not have such
a snap after all.

THE CALL ON COLNON.
Eureka Standard.
The State Harbor Commissioners and
Mr. Colnon, the particular, bright and
shining light who reflects his effulgence
from the pages of the StocKton Mail,
receive a most genuine roasting in The
Call of March 16. Leaving the harbor
piling contract, over which the Mail be
came bo abusive some weeks ago, Tna
Call has been Investigating tne construc
tion of the new ferry depot at the foot of
Market street. It is shown that -n many
instances the specifications have been
changed and that at each change tne con
tractor makes a lot of money by P utl '""B
in cheaper material. The contract for tha
galvanized iron called for No. 22 iron, and.
by consent of the Commissioners No. 2t»
iron waa used, saving the contractor over
$2<>oo2 < >00 The Call also asserts that the Com
missioners paid this contractor about fcOua
for covering certain walls with iron,
which he had agreed to do In his original
contract. __
The same crooked work is done, so Tna
Call avers, all along the line. The steel
work is not up to contract; the brickwork,
which the contract says- should be of Ro
man pressed brick, is done in common
brick worth less than a quarter as much,
and throughout the contractors are pock.
eting money at the expense of the people.
If this be true— and The Call would
scarcely dare make such specific charges
unless they are true— Brother Colncn of
the Mall will need to use more fairness,
more explanations and more argument
than his former reply to the Standard
contained to convince the people of this
State that they are getting a square deal
at the hands of > udd's Harbor Commis
sioners. It will be well for this bellicosa
official to use his pencil to explain tha
reason for the failure of the commission
to hold its contractors to their contracts
and not allow money to be drawn from
the pockets of the people to fatten tho
bank accounts of those who contracted
to do the work. The ferry depot will cost
far more than it should, and as it is done
by the State the people of the whole State
have an interest in seeing that jobbery'
and corruption shall not run rampant
through all departments of its construc
tion. Will President Colnon rise and ex
plain?

AN EPOCH IN HISTORY.
The Federal gold reserve has now
passed $170,000,000 and goes on climbing
up while gold continues to be imported
from abroad in large quantity. This is
the first time in the history of the coun
try that a war scare has seemed to draw
gold voluntarily into the public treasury
and into the money markets of the na
tion. But as war scares now encompass
the earth, the yellow metal has small

SWITCHING YARD
II THE STREETS
Southern Pacific Impo
sition at San Jose.
OUTGROWTH OF GANG RULE
CONSTANT MENACE TO LIVES
OF TRAVELERS.
Two of the Principal Thoroughfares
of the City Recklessly En
croached Upon by the
Monopoly.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 21.— As a result of
being in the toils of a corrupt political
gang San Jose is being imposed upon
by the Southern Pacific monopoly. Two
of the principal streets — First and San
Pedro — are being used as a switching
yard at the broad jjauge depot. This is
a detriment to tho city. It decreases
the value of property in that vicinity,
besides being a menace to travelers.
Teams are frequently frightened, and
hardly a day passes but some serious
accident is not narrowly averted.
North First street is one of the finest
thoroughfares in the city. The same
can be said of North San Pedro street.
Both lead to the center of town and are
the thoroughfares of much travel. Be
tween Julian and Washington the
Southern Pacific Railroad crosses the
streets. Trains on the coast division
and Niles route cross these streets
many times a day. But not satisfied
with this, the railroad company
switches cars across these driveways
all day long. A flagman is provided,
but even then there is danger from the
continual switching. The street is
blocked by teams waiting to cross, and
First and San Pedro streets are virtu
ally pre-empted for railroad yards.
North First street contains some of
the finest residences in the city, and but
a block beyond the railroad crossing is
the Hotel Vendome. The hostelry is
filled by guests from all over the United
States, and that the city's main thor
oughfare should remain in such a con
dition is a disgrace to the municipality.
People living in the neighborhood have
protested time and again against the
condition of the streets, but the City
Council has never done anything.
Public opinion is unanimous that the
Southern Pacific Company should be
compelled to remove its freight yards.
It owns ample ground a mile from the
city, in the Polhemus tract, that is suit
able for railroad purposes. Prom time!
t<> time it has been reported that the '
freight business of the company would j
be removed there, but the indifference j
of gang-controlled City Councils has |
allowed the railroad imposition to con
tinue unmolested.
Some time ago the Bnard of Trade
took up the matter. It was discussed
and a committee appointed to wait
upon the company, but that was all
that was done.
The manner In which the street is
used is condemned by the entire city,
but in its gang-ridden condition San
Jose seems powerless to resist this en
croachment of the Southern Pacific.
NATIONAL SENTIMENT
FAVORS EXPANSION
President McKinley Deluged With
Letters Urging Retention of
the Philippines.
NEW YORK, Aug. 21.— The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Secretary Alger was much interested
this morning as to the contention in
different quarters as to whether the ca
pitulation had included the Philippines.
A very prominent and observant official
said to-night that if the word ""su
burbs"" mentioned in the terms of
agreement was translated back into
Spanish a clearer idea might be
formed. He was conversant with the
fact that the Spanish word was pliant
and many-sided and more may have
been meant by what was translated
into ""suburbs"" than is contemplated by
our term ""suburb."" And yet other
opinion here opposes the suggestion
that the agreement was received with
General Merritt's perfect knowledge of
the word ""suburbs,"" and that, there
fore, the claim that the Philippines
were meant is out of the question.
President McKinley and his Cabinet
are being made aware of the fact that
the sentiment of the country is strong
ly in favor of holding all of the Phil
ippines. Each day the mail brings to
the President and to each member of
the Cabinet many letters from all over
the country. Even before the capture
of Manila by Admiral Dewey and Gen
eral Merritt a great majority of the
writers of these letters urged that all
the islands should be held. Since that
victory the proportion of the writers
who favor retiring from them has
grown much smaller. It cannot be
Piii'l that the President has changed his
views on the subject up to this time,
but as he is Inclined to regard what
he understands to be the deliberate
judgment of the people of the coun
try he may, when the time comes to
Instruct the peace commissioners, give
them to understand that he considers
the situation in the Philippines to be
such it will be the duty of the United
States to hold them.
Representative Qrosvenor, who has
just returned from Europe, was at the
White House to-night and had a talk
with the President about the situation.
T saw him as he was leaving the White
House and he told me he was heartily
Jn favor of the retention of the Philip
pines by the United States.
PORTO RICAN EVACUATION.
Spanish Troops Will Leave the Isl-
and in September.
LONDON, Auk. 2L— The Madrid corre
spondent of the Sunday Times says: The
ation of Porto Rico will begin in
September, but it is not expected that the
disbanding of the Cuban troops will be
commenced before December.

FRANCE OFFERED
TO AID HAWAI
Incident of the Cable
Legislation.
CALL'S REPORT CONFIRMED
PBOMISES MADE BY A FRENCH
COMTANY.
Sought in Every Possible Way to
Prevent the Granting of a
Franchise to an Ameri
can Corporation.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Aug. 10.— As far back
as February 11 The Call published In
this correspondence an item in refer
ence to a proposition for a French
trans-Pacific cable connecting with
Tahiti and Honolulu, which created a
sensation in the United States and
Europe and received the honor of an
equivocal contradiction from persons
interested in suppressing the informa
tion on behalf of rival schemes then
practically pending before the Govern
ments of Hawaii and America.
In the throes of the dissolution of the
Hawaiian republic and the personal
unpleasantness thereby engendered, the
true secret has reluctantly oozed out
in sjijte o.f the secretive manner in
; whi.-h It has been handled by the rnori
j bund Cabinet.
It appears, from reliable authority,
that The Call was correct in its state
ment. The French warship Duguay
Trouln at the same time that it brought
the proposition for making Honolulu a
port of call for the steam is <>f the
Messageries Imperiales Line brought
a request to the Hawaiian Government
that no special or exclusive franchise
be granted to any trans-Pacific cable
company until a proposition fur a
French cable connection with Tahiti
had been fully considered by the Ha
waii;: n Government, even although the
United States Government had to be
first considered in any negotiation for
landing a foreign cable on Hawaiian
shores.
Upon three subsequent occasions did
the representative of the French Gov
ernment and the prompters appear be
fore the Executive Council and plead
his cause and strenuously oppose the
granting of any exclusive franchise to
any Hawaiian, American or foreign,
company. It was this opposition that
induced a section of the Cabinet and
its supporters to make so strenuous a
fight in the Legislature against the ex
clusive franchise of the Pacific (Scrym
ser) cable bill, which subsequently
won its fight in so extraordinary and
mysterious a manner as to compel ad
miration of the ability which en
gineered it and comment on the sudden
docility with which votes flocked to it.
If I am correctly informed, there will
not be found among the archives of the
Government of the republic of Hawaii
a single line of documentary evidence
in the way of contracts, letters or even
pieces of conversations to mark this in
teresting episode of the cable fight; but
this is not surprising w^en the se
cretive sympathies in the transaction of
public affairs by the Gevehmgericht of #
Hawaii become more fully appreciated.'
as they will be in course of time when
tongues become loosened in discussing
reminiscences. It is even now intimat
ed ""on the dead quiet"" that Franca
stood ready to tender diplomatic as
sistance in aid of the preservation of
Hawaiian independence had the slight
est approach to an entente cordiale
been made. If this be so, then one can
appreciate more fully the policy that
brought, upon more than one occasion
during the annexation campaign, firm
but delicate pressure upon the United
States with threats of looking else
where for political alliances, and the
motive which actuated the annexation
correspondents most closely allied with
the syndicates in suggesting that un
less the United States took Hawaii
some other nation would.
It also explains that lingering hope,
which even now, on the very eve of the
consummation of the marriage between
the greater and the lessor republic, still
■ tni-frozen breasts of the
uians — that rescue and restoration
of the national honor will yet arrive
from Europe. Unfortunately, perhaps,
no arguments on the. futility of the
hope can for the present prevail against
that deep-rooted sentiment of the pr-o
v.ho conscientiously oppose an
nexation. They will drift down the tide
of time like the Legitimists of Europe,
whose thrones know them no longer as
occupiers, but merely as transient
ghosts of dimly remembered grandeur.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 1893.
FULL PROTECTION
FOR CATHOLICS
Archbishop Ireland Is
Highly Pleased.
ASSURED BY THE PRESIDENT
NO TROUBLE ABOUT OUR NEW
POSSESSIONS.
Church Interests, His Grace Says,
Will Hiourjsh Better Under
Our Flag Than Ever
Before.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.— Archbishop
Ireland, who has been in the city for
several days, left to-night. During his
stay he has had several conferences
with President McKinley, with whom
his relations are of the most cordial
character. The Archbishop has declined
to discuss the significance of his calls
upcn the President, but it has been gen
erally understood that he was acting
in the Interest of the Cathcrlic church
for its protection in our new posses
sions. Archbishop Ireland dismisses as
without foundation the statements that
church matters are liable to cause dis
sensions. To the Associated Pre3s to
night he made the statement which fol
lows:
, ""The church question in our new pcs- I
sessions offers no difficulty whatever. .
Two principles are already settled by
the constitution and laws of America:
There will be no union of church and :
state, such as !•> established by custom
or concord in certain Catholic countries
of Europe, but there will be complete
protection of all properties and of all
persons.
■With such principles Catholics in the
United States are satisfied, and Catho
lics in our jiew possessions will be sat
isfied. The so-called church question
need not be considered by military or
peace commissions. It is fully regu
lated the moment the nag of this coun
try is raised over a territory. The peo
ple of our new possessions understand,
I am sure, this matter very well and
will loyally accept the situation. It
may not be very easy for them at first
to adapt themselves in all cases to this
situation, but the embarrassments felt
will be temporary.
""The people will soon realize that It
is their duty to support religion by ;
voluntary and personal contributions. ;
In the greater number of parishes, <
moreover, church properties yield :
| ample revenue to meet all expenses.
The church everywhere in our new cos- j
sessions is thoroughly organized: it
wears no missionary or experimental
aspect, but has the full form and the
full 'strength of complete organization
■ and is well prepared to care for all her !
j interests without the help of state or !
! charitable aid. It demands no favor,
no privilege — naught but liberty and
i the legal protection of the natural and ,
civil rights of its members.
""Certain people who talk of these ter
ritories as fields for missionary efforts
• from the United States do not know
what they are talking about. They !
might with as much sense organize
j missions for the conversion of the j
' Catholics of Santiago, Havana or San i
i Juan — and their labors would have as |
much prospect of Buccess in Washing
ton as in those cities of Cuba and '
Pojrto Rico. The separation of the !
countries of South America from Sbain

SUICIDE AT OROVILLE.
Despondent Traveling Salesman Cuts
His Throat.
OROVILL.E, Aug. 21.— A Swede named
Stark, who was traveling for a tailoring
firm in Sacramento, this morning commit
ted suicide. He stripped himself naked,
took a small one-blade' 1 , iron-handled
penknife that was dull, placed himself in
front of a looking-glass and cut his throat
from ear to ear. The cut was not deep,
but he had severed the windpipe and bled i
almost to death before he was discovered.
The blood had then coagulated, and he
was taken to the Infirmary, where two
physicians closed and sewed the wound,
But the man only lived until 3 o'clock in
the afternoon. He left a note to a friend
saying he wat Bick and had not a dime,
so he thought the easiest way to end his
misery was to kill himself. |

DAWSON CITY, N. W. T., Aug. 6.—
By order of Major Walsh a census of
the city of Dawson was taken last
Wednesday and 16,000 souls were count
ed within the town boundaries on that
day. The work was done by the
northwest mounted police, the city
being divided up into small districts
and the count was completed within
a few hours, so that, despite the un
settled condition of things, the fact
that four-fifths of the inhabitants live
in tents and nearly that proportion are
camped in such confusion as might be
expected to attend a stampede or the
retreat of a beaten army, it is believed
to be very close to the actual number
of people here. Five thousand more
are camped at the mouth of the Stew
art River, a few hours by the river
current from Dawson. Other thou
sands are camped at Little and Big
Salmon and the Pelly rivers.
I have been here a few more days
than six weeks and the scene
of this big bivouac remains un
changed. Thousands have gone
out, but other thousands have
taken their places. Building is going
on at a tremendous rate, but in pro
portion to the number of people who, if
they remain here, are yet to be housed,
it is nothing at all. The days are
shortening very rapidly. The long,
cold and dark winter is rapidly ap
proaching and still this big crowd sits
as in a trance, waiting for the L.ord
knows what. Eve,ry up-river boat
carries away as many as its decks will
hold, the passengers being stowed away
in any old way, fur the live days' trip,
there being no room for b-.'ds. The
earlier down-river boats are crowded,
but since the demonstration of the
practicability of the up-river route,
which is so much shorter, must of those
hurrying homeward go that way.
There are three small boats plying
from here up the river. They run
from here to White Horse Kapids,
where they connect (with a portage to
above the canyon) with boats to Ben
nett. They make the round trip in
about ten days. Their beat efforts
from now until the river closes will
scarcely make an impression on the
camp, although they will be more and
more crowded as the margin of the
summer nakrows. Nine-tenths of this
big crowd that is camped and idling
here does not know. what it is going to
do. Being asked they will plainly tell
you so. They came into this faraway,
isolated country with vaerue notions of
what they were to do and how they
were to do it when they, got here; ar
rived and face to face with the hard
conditions and the tremendous strug
gle for fortune that is going on here,
their uncertain plans are dissipated
and they sit in their tents and cook
their meals and sleep, drawing their
blankets a little closer about them as
the night grow colder and wait and
wait.
With the first fleck of snow, less
than six weeks hence, there will
probably be another such sailing of the
great flotilla as took place at Bennett
and La Barge less than six weeks ago.
The destination this time will be St.
Michael. But it takes money to get
""back to the States,"" even from St.
Michael, ani a great proportion of this
crowd lacks the required amount. Out
fits are being sold in every direction,
auction sales are in progress in al
must every block, afternoon and even
ing, and the prices of the great mass
of stuff that is sold is little if any above
that at which it was purchased away
back in some city of the States, and
the dragging of it over that terrible
""summit,"" over mountains and lakes
and rivers and through freight and
customs offices goes for nothing. This
sacrifice will go on and increase until
the time limit for getting out is
passed. ; /i ■
The price of certain provisions re
mains high, these being scarce and
especially desirable here, such as on
ions, potatoes and vegetables, that may
be obtained fresh. , Onions readily sell
at $1 a pound and potatoes at 50 cents.
Beef was offered to-day at 60 cents, it
having fallen from $1. The run of
salmon has begun and although the fish
are not in the finest ' condition after
their swim of 2000 miles from the sea,
they sold readily for $1 50 a pound at
first, but have since been bought at 25
cents. The price of meals at restau
rants is still kept up to Jl5O and $2 50.
A meal may be had for $1, but it is
scant and of a quality below that
served for. 5 cents in San Francisco. .
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Bella has made the run to St.
Michael and return and brings little en
couraging news, concerning the new
boats upon which so many have under
taken to reach Dawson this summer. It
is reported that there are twenty-two
boats in various stages of construction
at and near St. Michael, and that some
twenty others are being built at Dutch
Harbor or Unalaska. Some of the com
panies operating these boats are mak
ing big preparations here to do busi
ness through them, but they do not
come. The Empire Line and the Alaska
Exploration Company are both building
big warehouses, but the boats that were
relied upon to bring the goods to store
in them are not even reported in the
river. Very many plans that were based
upon the arrival of these boats have
already gone to smash and It is freely
predicted that very many of the boats
will be unable to get their passengers
up the river, and that the experiences
of last winter, suffered by the passen
gers of the Hamilton, Seattle No. 1.
Merwin, Governor Stoneman, Hettie B,
the Dwyer and others, will be suffered
again by very many mare this winter.
It is almost a fixed superstition of the
river that no boat can make the ascent
above the flats from St. Michael at its
first attempt. But four boats have done
so this summer, demonstrating the ab
surdity of. that saying. Two of them,
the Monarch and the Sovereign,  be
longed to a company wholly new on the
river, the Columbia : . Navigation Com
pany, and the boats were In charge of
men who had never seen it before.
White men were in the pilot-houses.
Thus were destroyed at once all the set
tled beliefs of the river concerning the
navigation of this treacherous stream,
for it has long. been 5 held that only the
Indian who had grown familiar through
a life upon it could be trusted to pilot
a boat : through 5 its 1 shifting: ? channels.
It was shown that all that was neces
sary was tc be ready to take the water
while it was high enough and to put
competent boatmen in charge. The fail
ure to do- this by the men ,who have
enticed passengers to sail with them
by false statements and accepted
freight which they will be unable to
deliver will result in great suffering and
disaster and no doubt develop another
big cloud of damage suits next year.
The Seattle No. 3, which is long over
due, is not reported anywhere in the
river, and the eighteen tons of United
States mail which is in her care, or the
care of the company, is causing great
anxiety and disgust because of its non
arrival.
On the little steamer Flora of the
Bennett .Lake and Klondike Navigation
Company, which leaves for White Horse
Rapids to-night, Major Walsh, Com
missioner to the Northwest Territory,
is a passenger. He is the highest offi
cial in the Territory, and, going to Ot
tawa, he will make his report and re
tire from the service. Major Walsh has
profound faith in the great richness of
the Territory— believes it to be the rich
est camp in the world. He says that he
will urge upon Parliament the imme
diate betterment of many of the con
ditions here. The waterway will be
cleared, he says, of the rocks that have
caused so many wrecks at White Horse
and in Thirty-mile rivers. He thinks
a telegraph line will connect Dawson
with the rest of the world before an
other year, and that po-lice posts at in
tervals of thirty miles will make it a
comparatively easy matter to travel be
tween the ""out"" and ""inside"" this win
ter. He believes the camp is a fixture
for many years. The departure of Ma
jor Walsh is very generally regretted.
Before leaving the major commissioned
D. W. Davis, Dr. Richardson, Captain
of Police Sterns, Captain lilies and Pro
secuting Attorney Wade to serve as a
town committee, with full powers.
The Anglian, a small steamer of the
Canadian Development Company, ar
rived from Lake Teslin. She brought
seventy soldiers, whom she landed ajt

larly on the upper river. The Viola, the
smallest of the fleet of steamboats, has
also arrived from up the river, and the

body of George Mulhern near the Little
Salmon.
Three Indians brought down from

LIVING SKELETONS
CARRIED ABOARD
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Aug. 9.—To
ri;: y the first of our Spanish prisoners
were put on board the transport we
hay* hired to take them home. Ten
thousand of the men have been in
camp for more than three weeks, just
outside the city limits. They were
much nearer to the palace than our
own men. They were our prisoners and
we, one and all, avoided the roads that
led' near their camps because of the vile
odors that arose therefrom.
To-day, as the Spaniards passed
through* the city on the way to ihe
docks, we saw sights that brought
tears to the eyes of men who are not
readily moved to tears. Down on the
clocks, in the narrow stiiu of shade at
a warehouse, some 200 Spaniards
waited orders to move on to the lighter
which would convey them to thy mucn
talked-of Spanish hospital ship Ali
cante. These men were of a sickly pal
lo- hollow-cheeked, weak and thin.
""We are the men who haw brought
the sick into the town on litters,"" they
explained.
Down on the wharf, being loaded on
the steam lighter Bessie, we~e long
lines of stretchers, each with its pitl.tl
burden— faces that looked like death's
heads, every line of the skull marked
on the yellow skin, protruding- teeth
over which lips would not close. One
man grasped, in a claw that had crush
ed them, three American hardtacks.
Others had food hidden under their
Bcant covering. Their weight was as
nothing, yet four well men staggered
under the burden of one stretched
Down the city streets came other
processions of stretchers. Vanquished
und sick, moaning, staggering, they
drifted into the town ill day long.
When the city surrendered the pros
pective return to Spain brought joy to
many hearts. The fulfillment of the
promise was sad.
The American ambulances have been
detailed to help carry those unable to
walk, and we have erected tents on the
docks where the sick can wait until the
lighter is ready for them.
""It was not a camp out there,"" said a
Spanish officer, ""it was a graveyard.
Between two and three hundred"" went
into the hospital daily. It was not a
hospital — there were no medicines, there
was no attendance. Forty men were
dying every day, and the trenches are
full of the dead. We have saved you
many a $20 for passage money to
Spain. There are 9000 out there yet —
nnly a thousand came in to-day — but
thiy won't last long. Dysentery — camp
dysentery we call it. and it 's worse
than the plague — is carrying them off.""
A white-haired officer, with stars and
bands on his sleeves, but so thin and
weak and pale that he looked more like
a skeleton than a man, walked down
the wharf, supported by his wife, who
was as much in need of support as he
was himself. Over a loose board they
both trippod and fell. There are two
young children in the party who cry
almost continuously. Finally they all
got on board, the women to spend ten
clays on a filthy, horrible troop ship.
There are many women going thus,
wives of officers, who cannot pay for
a passage.
These Spanish troop ships bid fair to
rival old-timo slave ships in the mis
ery and sufferings that will be con
fined within their sides on the voyage
back to Spain.
Our own soldiers were sick, but the
conditions of th.c Spaniards are many
times worse than those of our men,
who seem strong and heaithy compared
with thorn. The Spaniards were not
in this condition when they moved to
their death camp just three weeks ago.
Just how far we are expected to pro
vide care for a vanquished foe is a
question now being discussed in this
town. Kvery one admits and has ad
mitted that the Spaniard has been a
good enemy, a good fighter, and the
Americans who took off their hats to
the Spanish on the 17th of July did so
with true homage to brave men. As
the pitiful lines of Spanish prisoners
stagger through the streets of the city
for the next week or so, feebly step
ping out of the way of -edestrians.
looking fearfully at rattling carts and
In sad contrast to our strong men in
brown, the American? who see them
will be inclined to again uncover their
heads, prompted by the same feeling of
homage to brave men.
POPE HOLDS A BECEPTION.
Seems to Have Begained His Good
Health ana Spirits.
ROME, Aug. 21.— The Pope to-day held
a reception in honor of his saint's day.
Many prelates, nobles and representatives
of Catholic associations were in atten
dance. His Holiness appeared to be in
good health and spirits, and in spite of
the length of the reception, which lasted
an hour and a half, showed no signs of
fatigue. He was the recipient of a large
number of gifts.

THE CHALLENGE
Represents Sir Thomas

EN ROUTE TO NEW YORK

GUEST.
Talks of the Motive Which Prompted
an Irish Yachtsman to Seek
to Win the Amer
ica's Cup.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
QUEBEC, Aug. 21.— Hon. Charles
Russell, the son of Lord Russell of
Killowen, is here, the bearer of a chal
lenge from Ireland to all yachtsmen in
America for the America's cup. Mr.
Russell arrived in Quebec on Friday
and is the guest of Solicitor General
Charles Fltzpatrick. He will leave to
morrow for New York, where he will
be the guest of Bourke Cockran. The
challenger is confident the details of
the race will be speedily arranged. To
the Associated Press representative he
said:
""The desire to challenge for the cup
Is not a new idea with Sir Thomas
Lipton. Twelve years ago he made
the proposition to the Cork Yacht Club
to challenge with an Irish yacht, but
at the time there were difficulties in
the way and the contest was not
brought about.""
""Does Sir Thomas intend to put his
own yacht into the proposed contest?""
Mr,. Russell was asked.
""No,"" he said. ""Sir Thomas does
not own a racing yacht at the present
time, but he has always taken a lively
interest in yacht racing and is a mem
ber of several yacht clubs. In fact,
he has always been in all forms of
sports.""
'What is his motive for issuing the
challenge at this time?""
""Sir Thomas' view is this: England
and Scotland have had repeated oppor
tunities to compete for the trophy and
have failed, but Ireland has had no
chance. He thinks Ireland should no
longer remain the Cinderella of the
family, and, in yachting at any rate,
should take her proper place among
the nations of the earth. The yacht
will be built in Ireland and she is to
be called the Shamrock. Her crew
will be Irish and she is to be built in
the yards of Harland & Y\'olf, Bflfast.
Right Hon. W. J. Pierre, the chief part
ner, is taking the greatest possible in
terest in the matter. His firm is the
builders of the White Star liners.""
SENSATIONAL LIBEL
AGAINST THE NOYO
Captain of the Steamer Charged With
Attempting to Sink the W.
H. Evans.
SEATTLE, Aug. SL—ln the United
States District Cour^ a sensational libel
for $24,000 damages has been filed against
the steamer Noyo, said to be owned by
Kiinball & Co. of San Francisco. The
Lewis-Klondike Expedition Company of
Baltimore brings the action. The latter
company owns the river steamer W. H.
Evans, which the Noyo was under con
tract to tow to St. Michael. Captain W.
H. Edgett. master of the Noyo, is charged
with having attempted to sink the Evan?
at the mouth of the straits, again off
Dixons Entrance, and later cut her loose
at Howcan Island, where she was badly
damaged and has not since been able to
reach the Yukon.
PROTESTS TO SPAIN.
England Objects to Erection of Forts
Near Gibraltar.
MADRID, Aug. 21.— 1n the course of an
Interview had lnst night with a mem
ber of the Cabinet by a representative of
the Associated Press, the Minister said
England had presented a note to Spain
asking: for explanations on the subject
of the fortifications being erected by
Spain near Gibraltar which, the note de
clares, are unjustified, in view of the
good relations existing between the two
countries.
Spain is absolutely quiet. Don Carlos
has given his partisans strict orders not
to commit acts of rebellion, while the
divisions among the Republicans render
that party powerless.

steamers from Alaska to-day brinar
news of new gold finds and stampedes.
On the Dirigo was George Alexander
of Dungeness, Wash., who has just re
turned by the rivers from the Klon
dike. He says:
""Just before we left rich discovert
were reported from the north fork uf
Forty Mile Creek, on the American
side. On August 2 and 3 a stampede
of fully 500 men left Dawson in small
boats for the new diggings. They were
mostly newcomers, on the verge of
desperation. They welcomed the re
port as a godsend and immediately set
sail for Forty Mile. It is believed that
several thousand men will leave Daw

trict."" -
Passengers on the steamer George W.
Elder bring the news of a new find at
the foot of the glacier on the east fork
of the SXaguay River, about 229 miles
from Skaguay around the trail. A. \Y.
Davis, formerly from San Francisco,
says:
""On August 1 two prospectors named
Noyes and Patchen came into Skaguay
with $1000 in gold of the highest qual
ity, and which, they claimed they took
out in a few days from the east fork
of the river. A stampede immediately
followed among those left in Dyea and
Skaguay.""
Mr. Davis states that the most en
couraging reports are received from the
new diggings on Pine ('reek. The day
before he left a miner came into bka
quay with $1400 in gold from the creek.

GREAT STAMPEDE
TO RELOCATE RICH
KLONDIKE CLAIMS
Dishonest Methods in Dawson's
Gold Commissiooer's Office
Cause Trouble.
Bribery Seeri)s to Run Raropant and Rights of
Poor Miners Usurped by Powerful
Corporations.
BY SAM W. WALL.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DAWSOX, N. W. T., Aug. 31.—To
morrow will witness another of the big
Etampedes, such as have characterized
the history of this camp. And out of
It will no doubt come another of the
outrageous scandals that have gone
hand in hand with them. Under a rul
ing of the Gold Commissioner all claims
upon which the proper representation
work — three months' continuous labor
— had not been done within the pre
scribed time-limit of one year, were to
revert to the crown upon September 1.
It v is given out that these claims were
to b* sold to the highest bidder, but
whether publicly or not was not stated.
A great many claims have not been
properly represented and among them
are some of great value. The reasons
for the r.jn-representation are many.
The scarcity of food at this point last
winter drove many of the owners away
to where they became entangled in
other matters, or to where, for a multi
tude of other reasons, they could not
return within the time. Many of the
claims were sent out for sale and pend
ing negotiations the work was neglect
ed here. As September 1 drew near
Gold Commissioner Fawcett changed
his mind. The reason is not known.
There was a good deal of complaint
concerning and criticism of the ruling
which took so many mure claims out
-of the reacft of the miner and prospec
tor, following that other law that ap
propriated to the crown every alter
nate ten claims on every newly located
creek. At any rate a new order was
promulgated under which the unrepre
sented claims should be throvn open to
all who held miners' certificates for re
location. This was at first hailed with
some joy, which, however, very soon
became tempered with suspicion. It
began to appear that certain persons
were ser-uring information as to the lo
cation of valuable claims where repre
sentation work had not been reported.
Individuals closely in touch with the
Gold Commissioner's office were known
to be canvassing the creeks and takinr
note of all claims where there was even
the slightest technical failure to fulfill
the requirements. Men are posted on
or near the unrepresented claims and
to-morrow will see the driving of a
forest of stakes all through the mining
district and a tremendous rush upon
the Gold Commissioner's office, which
will probably be congested for weeks
to come with applicants for recording.
So great has become the general dis
gust at the mismanagement and evi
dent corruption in the Gold Commis
sioner's office that I hear of a move
ment being talked of looking to the pre
ferment of charges of bribery against
every one connected with it. The men
active in revolt are all of them Eng
lishmen, Canadians and Australians,
the latter being the leaders and by far
the most outspoken in denunciation of
the methods and mismanagement of
the office at this time. Gold Commis
sioner Fawcett is almost universally
acquitted of being a party to fraud or
corruption, but there is little charity
for him on that account inasmuch as it
is allowed such license under his eyes.
Fawcett acts the part of a clerk in his
own oflice and when not engaged in
hearing contests of claims is found
standing at a desk and issuing miners'
certificates or making record of claims
at $10 and $15 a head. He certainly
earns his salary if merely putting in
the full time in his office day by day
does that. Many charge the irregulari
ties of his office to this fact, declaring
that he is so busy with small affairs
that he is unable to see What is so clear
to everybody else.
Prosecuting Attorney Wade .has». per
haps, of all the high officials of the out
going administration, been most direct
ly and personally criticized as having
fathered or been interested in many of
the monopolies and rings that have
worked to the great harm of the free
(?) miner. The day before he took the
steamer for the outside he attacked a
young newspaper man, Leroy Pelatier,
a Canadian, for having written too
freely concernlrig him to his home
paper. Pelatier was called upon to
withdraw his statements, refused and
was knocked d.own and badly beaten.
Wade is as big£a fellow as Pelatier is
slight. The took place in the
warehouse of the N. A. T. Company,
and was evidently prearranged by
Wade, the editor of a friendly paper
being present by invitation.
Among the many petty annoyances
to which the people at large are sub
jected is the lack of sufficient clerical

force in the Gold Commissioner's office
and the postoffice. It was thought that
this had been corrected in the post
office, but the long line of impatient
men takes its daily place in front, of the
door now as before. There has been no
interruption in the nuisance at the Gold
Commissioner's. The habit of feeing the
policeman on guard at the side d<>or
by way of gaining admittance has
grown until it is next to impossible to
get in any other way. This is the com
monest and pettiest of the briberies
that make a part of nearly every
transaction with: the Government of
fices, insomuch that Canadians confess
to a sense of shame in being Cana
dians. Within the past few days no
tices have been posted about town to
the effect that exclusive facilities and
privileges have been granted to a
company for securing mail from the
postoffice, and that this company will
deliver mail to individuals promptly
at $6 per quarter and to business firms
at $10 per quarter. It would seem to
one who had grown accustomed to the
methods here that this was only a re
adjustment of the old plan, a transfer
of the required fee from the plain,
yellow-striped policeman to the favored
corporation. A corporation has the
right to place booms at the mouth of
the Klondike, and so no individual has
the right to so much as a stick of drift
wood in that river. A corporation has,
or several corporations have, the right
to the timber on almost all the islands,
and for miles and miles along the
shores of the Yukon, so that individuals
are warned against cutting cabin logs,
and any who do so take great chances
of having them confiscated upon
reaching Dawson. Arrived in Dawson
the individual is confronted with the
I big townsite corporation holding its
building lots at figures impossible to
the average prcspector. He is warned
off the wide stretch of level lands that
is the townsite and compelled to build
his cabin on the distant hills, where it
will be almost a day's job to get water
during the winter.
American doctors and American law
yers are forbidden to practice here.
The lawyers in many cases effected a
compromise by associating themselves
with Canadians, the Americans doing
the office work and the Canadians go
ing into court and appearing solely as
the counsel of record. This worked
very well for both parties, to the ar
rangement, for the great majority of
the population are Americans, and the
American lawyer is thus readier at se
curing clients. With the doctors it was
different, there being no necessity; for
relying upon the Americans, and an
edict absolute was written against
them. One prominent doctor, continu
ing to attend a patient after notice
was served, was thrown into jail. The
patient died and that was another
scandal. No American doctor is per
mitted to put out a sign that he is
SUCh. •"""";-!
In the meantime the hospitals are
crowded with patients, and typhoid
fever has become epidemic. The grave
yard, now almost in the heart of the
rapidly grown town, gives almost con
i stant occupation to the grave digger.
i There are eighty-three patients in the
Catholic hospital and forty in the re
cently opened Good Samaritan, more
than either has proper provision for.
The capacity- of the Catholic hospital
is being doubled as fast as men can
construct the addition, private hospi
tals are bejng opened and sickness- is
to be found in cabins and tents in ev.ry
part of the town. There is no public
records of the deaths or burials. Since
it opened a short .time ago there have
been two deaths at the Good Samaritan
Hospital — Albert-Smith, a German, and
Duncan Bertram, a Frenchman. There
have died at the Catholic hospital since

Flags are at half mast, to-diy be

ton, master of the steamer Willie- Irv
ing, that has made such a record this!
summer ih plying safely and swiftly,
the Upper Yukon, Capitain Barring
ton has been sick, about two weeks and;
has received the best of care. The
steamer, with his brother, Sydney,
aboard, is now up the river. The broth
ers, with two others, bought the
steamer early In: the summer, paying
$21,000 for her. She was put. on the
run between here and White Horse
and became so popular ■with: those go
ing out that she has already returned
the purchase; money. Captain Barring
ton came from the Puget Sound and
was for years in command of a speedy
boat plying between Tacoma and Se
attle.
Robbery and assault, that had be
come notable for its absence, has re~
cently broken out with considerable
violence. The ferryman on the Klon
dike has twice been held up within the
week; a man on the El Dorado trail
was shot at, beaten and robbed a few
days ago; a hole was cut in a window
on Front street and a thief made away
with a handful of nuggets. A number
of thefts are reported of caches. Few
arrests are made. The disgust and
disappointment of thousands who are
camped here, and who know of no other
way to recoup themselves, are In this
finding some expression. On the whole,
however, this is a marvelously orderly
town, considering the composition of it.
The building of the town keeps up its
tremendous pace.
Almost every day sees the foundation
laid for some big warehouse or business
house as well as a score of cabins. The
little city takes on a new complexion
with each week as it passes. The two
big companies, the Alaska Commercial
and North American Trading and
Transportation, are still at the front as
the two largest commercial houses here,
but they are by no means the only ones,
as was the case. last fall/ Immense
warehouses of a full dozen other com
panies have ranged themselves along i
the water front beside them. Tons and
tons and tons of provisions have been
landed here, together with boat loads
of other freight in which is included al
most every article that by any possi
bility might be desired. Prominent in
this varied freight are silk dresses.
There was cv a high silk hat came
to town and a man wore it down
through the main street against a
wager that he dare not. It returned to
to the starting point intact, but ap
peared upon the streets not again.
Thirty boats have landed their freight
and passengers here thus far this sum
mer and many more are on the way.
Many of these brought barges. The
Louise alone, with two barges, brought
nine hundred tons. The Seattle Nos. 1
and 2 have just landed 300 tons of flour.
No, there will be no scarcity of pro
visions this wl.iter, but It is quite evi
dent that a high average price will bo
maintained. Flour Is held at $H> a
hundred and it is likely that will be the .
prtce of it for the Winter; bacon cannot
be bought in' the big stores under 25
cents, while butter is still $1 50 a pound.
Butter is either really scarce or is be
ing withheld from the market. No.ne
of it has a. peared in the auctions for
some time. The cry of the auctioneer is
heard everywhere about the streets In
the evening. He has an infinite varierty

the store prices. The tendency of the

books badly and appeared to be a trifle
short in his accounts, not more than
$120, which it b thought will be found

Winbolt was about 25 years of age and
came this year from his home in Lon

errors being discovered he took a dost

small shortage accounts for his foolish

DELMAS CLOSES A MOST
POWERFUL ARGUMENT
Possible Evils Should the Demurrer
in the Jarman-Bea Case Be
. ; •'. Sustained. :
SAN JOSE. Oct. I.— Attorney Delmas ar
gued all day Friday in the Jarman-Rea
slander case. He finished shortly before
adjournment, after talking for one and a
half ' days. Attorney Morehou.se then
opened his argument in favor of sustain
ing the defendant's demurrer. A few
minutes after he commenced the court
adjourned until- Tuesday morning, at
■which time he will proceed.
Delmas' argument was strong and con
vincing. He said that if the cemurrer
were sustained and Jarman had no cause
of action it would let bars down for every
gang slanderer to make a house to house
canvass at the forthcoming election and
maliciously attack the reputation, of re
spectable candidate.
The outcome of: the argument on the
demurrer is watched with interest. If
the demurrer is- sustained it means a dis
missal of the case.

THERE was trouble on Miller &
Lux's ranch the other day.
Henry Miller, ""the boss,"" had
taken it into his head to relieve
a coyote trap and he found out
something he didn't particularly want
to know. The coyote had been caught
fn this trap the night before, but for
some reason nobody had killed it.
Then the old man saw it. He hadn't
had the fun of killing a coyote for a
long time (not since the Legislature
ihe bounty off scalps) so he laid
this one out with professional pride.
When the beast was taken from the
Mr. Miller turned it over and at
began to swear.
""Who in thunder did that?"" he Bhout-
Who has been clapping my brand

The 'boys slowly came forward and
with Innocent and surprised counte

told Miller. The branding on the coy

-"".""Here you, Pachugo. lasso that fel

the quick-footed coyotes came in Fight.
Old Pachugo is one of the best hands

.First the rope feH short, then it went

went scampering gleefully over the

prairie dog holes as he could. At
last old Pachugo was successful and
the coyote was pulled over nn his back
with a broken neck, the lariat having
landed in just the right spot.
Mr. Miller jumped off his horse and
turned over the dead animal. Sure

wprse still there were the earmarks.
Miller <t Lux's coyote beyond a doubt.

""I can tell, because the coyote smells
like rice.""
As the Nevada end of the ranch was
over a hundred miles away Mr. Miller
I not make old Pachugo prove his
statement. But he was by no means
convinced, so he made the whole crowd
put in the day on a coyote hunt.
•If I knew which of you it was I'd
fire him right now,"" said Miller.
""<;iad I'm not that Chinaman,"" said
old Pachugo.
""I'll tell you who it was."" said Char

""Well, out with it. The Portuguese

""All right,"" said Charley, ""it was that
nigger over on the west side, and he
done it fur your interest.""
""My interest? What do you mean?""
yelled Miller, beginning to get mad
again.
""Well, you see,"" said Charley, ""there
ain't no bounty on coyote scalps just
now, so there ain't no use in killing
them. Now the nigger flggered that
he'd brand all the coyotes in the State,
and then when you get th» bounty law
of $2 50 a scalp re-enacted at the next
Legislature nobody would have a right
to kill the varmints except us. And
you can just figger on how much money
we'd have.""
Then without a word Mr. Miller got
on his horse and rode off, his head
buried In the deepest kind of thought.
The last words any of the cowboys
hoard him say wore: ""Thirty coyotes
killed fur nothin'.""
Enough branded coyotes were found
during the day's hunt to show that If

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1899.
END OP TWO OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST FORGERS
The Bidwell Brothers, Who Stole Millions fori) the BanK of
England, Have Just Died Suddenly in a Small Montana Town.
THE sudden deaths last week of
Austin Byron Bidwell and George
Bidwell, in Butte, Mont., removes
two of the gr atest forgers and
criminals of modern times.
The brothers died within a few
days of each other from colds which de
veloped Into pneumonia.
Austin Bidwell, with his brother George,
McDonald and Edward N
formed a quartet of forgers, check rais
ers and ciooks which played upon the
siaH old Bank of England to the tune of
nearly two million dollars.
Through the most unusual efforts put
forth by detectives and police authorities
in cvi ;y part of the world, the tjuartet
were finally captured, and after a sensa
tional trial were sentenced to life impris
onment. George Bidwell secured his re
lease in the early nineties, and Austin was
also released a few years later through
the unceasing efforts of his sister, who ?e
--cured one petition after another, which
she presented to the British Government,
finally obtaining her reward only after
Bldwell had agreed never to place his
foot upon British soil after his release.
He was accompanied by Scotland Yard
detectives to the steamship wharf, and
they never lost sight of him until the
steamer sailed.
Ail England was startled In April, 1878,
when It became known that the Bank of
England, the ""Old Woman of Thread
needle street,"" had been victimized by
American criminals to the amount of $2,
--000,000.
George McDonald was captured In New
York harbor on the steamer Thuringla;
Austin Bldwell was caught In Havana
with Noyes, and George Bldwell was
taken by the English police in Edinburgh.

the vaqueros had not been In the busi
ness in a wholesale way they had cer
tainly branded enough coyotes to make
the double H mark famous in all the
coyote villages throughout California-
After Miller had gone the vaqueros
admitted that the branding was done
by them ""just for fun."" Riding the
range and working the round-up oc
casionally needs something to enliven
it. When the bounty was removed from
coyote scalps tho animals increased
rapidly and the horseback riders grad
ually fell into tho habit of putting
spurs to their ponies in chase and
roping the animals. One day one of
them, in a frolicsome mood, clapped
the branding imn on the animal, added
the Miller & Lux earmarks and turned
the coyote loose, ""Just to help swell
jhe big herds carrying the same marks
and to start a double H coyote herd.""
The men in th? different headquarters
of the big ranch looked on this as a
tremendous piece of ranch humor and
thereafter roping and marking scam
pering coyotes became one of the
standing jokes of the range rider.
Some of the vnqueros became so ex
pert in this line that they began to
take a pride in the character of the
work and in thf> increasing number of
coyotes they add><i to the herd. Grad
ually the 1 most expert of them began
to lasso big hnrfs and soon there wafl
started « bran<! of jackr.-ibbits bearing
the double H brand and earmarks.
There are not many hares in the band
yet, but enough to show that the double
H brand has promising running beef
In the jaekrabbit line.
The section ""bosses"" try their best
to stop these pranks of the vaqucros,
for roping coyotes and Jackrabbits is
apt to be hard on the horses as well as
the time of the playful herdsmen, but
the number of coyotes and hares shot
and trapped show that the happy-go
lucky and prankful vaqueros are car
rying on their sport In spite of watch
fulness.
Two bluejackets were once overheard
arguing as to who had the least work to
do on board a man-of-war, says the Corn
bill Magazine.
""It's the parson,"" said one.
"" 'Ow d'ye make that out?"" queried the
other.
"" 'Cos 'c's got no work to do, and all
day to do It in.""
""You ain't quite got it, Bill,"" retorted
his friend, while an inspired grin illu
mined his features. ""It ain't the parson,
it's the cap'n o' marines.""
•' 'Ow's that?""
""Wai, as you say, the parson's got no
work to do, and all day to do it in; but

The scheme by which the enormous for
geriea were successfully carried to a
profitable result was remarkable. Mc-
Donald, the Bidwells and Noyea secured
a building close to the Burlington Gar
dens Branch of the Bank of England and
posed as American merchants who had

lington Branch Bank, and conducted busi
ness apparently on a solid, substantial
basis for several months before starting
to put their scheme Into effect.
They had learned that time bills, when
deposited in a Batik of England branch,
were not sent to the signers to be in
itialed, as Is customary in this country,
so after fully establishing their credit
several good bills at short time were de
posited. Tlkso went through all right,
and then b< veral bills, the amounts of
which by the usp of aclda and clever pen
manship had been raised, were depos
ited. These were at three months time
and wer< ■' : I ted at various times and
in various amounts until the total rep
resented between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.
As the monej w.is drawn against thf»
bills it was used in the purchase of United
States bonds, and no suspicion was awak
ened until it was accidentally discovered
by the bank officials that several of the
bills bore no date. The bills purported
to be signed by the Rothschilds, Barinp
Brothers, Jay Cooke and McCulloch fk
Co., and a messenger was sent to the of
ficers of these bankers to have the date
affixed. Then the forgery and check
raising were discovered.

MADE PORTION OF SAN FRANCISCO
IS SLOWLY SETTLING
Surveyors Say the Lowep End of .Market Street Is Going Down at
the Rate of Three Inches a Yeap.
IS the ""made"" portion of San Fran
cisco subsiding gradually into the
waters of the bay?
This is not the question of a hot
headed, irresponsible alarmist; it i^
a problem which is seriously dis
turbing the minds of ckar-brained
citizens, who do business and own prop
erty in the most crowded and valuable
portion of San Francisco.
An ocular demonstration of the fact can
be gained by any one who will walk down
Market street to the ferry depot. He will
notice a curious irregularity in the side
walk? at the lower end of the thoroughfare.
Sometimes he will have to ascend an in
clined plane and walk along a raised plat
form three feet or more above the, road
way, at other times he will find the side-
walk on a level with the rest of the street.
If it had not been for the many new
buildings recently erected in this part of
the city the change in level might have
passed unnoticed by the layman, though
df course our engineers and surveyors
have known about it all along, and with
delicate Instruments hive carefully kept
track of the subsiding thoroughfare.
Whenever a new building is erected the
sidewalk has to be laid out in accordance
with the authorized city levels, which
have as their base a stone at the corner
of the sugar factory just under Tele
graph Hill. This building is planted firm
on the solid rock, and therefore cannot
Bettle, so that the surveyors can always
rely on the measurements tak^n from this
point. Jf the whole of Market street had
been rebuilt at once this alteration in the
level would not have mattered very much.
But as it is, the new buildings, with their
inconvenient humps of sidewalks, are few
and far between, while the old structures,
many of them flimsy shanties, remain
unaltered, cheerfully settling down with
the roadway into the blue mud of the bay.
""The lower portion of Market street,
near the ferry,"" said Mr. Tilton, the City
Surveyor, ""is settling at the rate of two
or three inches a year. Why, it is only
fifteen y.ars since Market street was
graded up to its proper level, and since
then it has sunk between two and three
feet. Of course the rate of subsidence
varies— in some places it is greater than
others— but this is about the average.""
Another practical illustration of the
fact, patent to the most casual observer,
is the new turntable now being put up by
the Market Street Railway Company in
front of the ferry depot. Stand behind
the turntable and you will see how much
higher it is than the foot of Market street.
The ears will have to run up quite an in
clir.e before they can In- spun round and
sent back on their return journey up
town.
Just as there is no lack of practical
demonstration, so there is no lack of ex
pert evidence available. Baron Uhlig,
the chief draughtsman for the Board of
Harbor Commissioners, has made a spe
cial study of the question during his
twenty-three years service with the de
partment. ""There is no doubt about the
subsidence,"" he said; ""it has been going
on for a long time, although I think the
rate at which the city is sinking is some
what less than in former years. Market
street is now two feet below the city
cry almost as quickly as the bank officials
and tied. Alarms were sent all over th*
world, with the resttlt that all four were*
captured. Austin B. Bldwell, who was
the ringleader, was captured In Havana
with his wife, whom he had just mar
ried, and was confined in the military
prison th.-re. He succeeded in effecting
his escape by Jumping from a balcony,
but was recaptured in the woods eighteen
miles from Havana two days alter.
There was no extradition law between
England and Spain at the time, find Bid
wen's lawyers fought bitterly against his
extradition, but he was sent to Englanrt
in July and placed on trial with his
brother and McDonald and Noyes. Ills
brother made an impassioned plea to the
court, declaring that Austin had notn
ing to do with the forgeries, and declar
ing that he alone was guilty. The plea
had no effect, however, and all four were
convicted and sentenced to life imprison
ment.
George Bidwell's health gave way under,
confinement, and he was liberated in ]SfR
He bent all his energies to secure the re
lease of his brother, aiding his sister In
every way. Their efforts were finally
successful and Austin returned to this
country a few years ago. He published
a book of his life, and was conspicuous
on the lecture platform for several years.
His health had never been good since his
confinement.
The story of the great forgery is told
in Austin Bidwell's reminiscences as fol
lows :
""Flndlnpr myself In London in 1872 with
a very clever partner and about $'
in our pockets, we resolved to tackle the
Bank of England, believing: that the
lightning ought to strike where the bal

Here is a startling fact. If the subsi

another ten or fifteen years it will only
require an extra high /tide to flood the
lqjyer portion of the main -thoroughfare
of the city and to swamp numbers of
wharves? on the water front. The damage
to property would be Incalculable.
One has to go back to the early days of
the city to trace the causes of this re
markable subsidence. In 1849, when the
pioneer argonauts thronged from all
parts of the world to Yerba Buena, the
waters of the bay covered what is now
the principal shipping: and business quar
ter of the city. The water-front line,
roughly speaking, trended inward from
where Folsom street now meets Spear
street. Thence it continued up Folsom to
Beale street and westward in a diagonal
line through.Howard and Mission streets
to the corner of Market and First. Curv
ing slightly inward the shore line crossed
the Intersection' of Pine and Sansome
streets, and followed very nearly the
line of Montgomery street to the cor
ner of Jackson. Here there was a small
lagoon, which carried the water still fur
ther inward, occupying the space on
which the old opera-house was later on
to be erected. The beach, turning almost
•at a right angle, now ran seaward again
to the intersection of Broadway and
Front.
Let any one take a pencil and trace
out this route on a map of the city and
he will realize the large area of San
Francisco which stands on made ground.
This little indentation of the bay, now
vanished from sight, was about 3800 feet
wide and extended inward 1700 feet, hav
ing an area of seventeen acres. Every
inch of this space had to be filled up in
order to make the present city, with its
continuous water front, possible. This
would not have mattered so much had
the filling up been done in a systematic
manner, with suitable and properly placed
material.'
In those good old days, however, every
body was too busy and excited rushing
after gold to think about the future of
the city. San Francisco was left to grow
out of the waters of the bay haphazard
fashion, just as she chose. Anything and
everything was dumped into the harbor
to fill It up, and it is even on record that

attack if one had that very rare com
bination outside of the law of capital,
determination and financial knowledge.
I determined to go to the front myself.
Within a few days I not only had an ac
count opened with the bank, but a fairly
good credit cstaHi.-'ic'l, and all this un-
der a fictitious name. Within a few
months I had borrowed nearly $5,000,0(30
from the bank on collateral and printed
my own collateral.
""I left England, believing the world
was mine, and settled down in the West
indies. I settled my scheme in life and
Bi t out to enjoy myself, not in an intem
perate way. i had no fear of the English
police, as I knew the English have an in
itnlinate idea of the ability of their own
police, and I never counted on their em
ploying the American police after their
own had failed to locate me. Unluckily
fer myself. I was mistaken. John Bull
had his back up and determined to have
nr> in his clutches, no matter what it
cost; so after the English police failed to
find me the bank employed the Pinker
tons, with orders to spare no expense.
The rinkertons put twenty of the be?t
men on the case and soon let daylight
into the whole affair.
""In the end I was arrested in my owti
h'.usp, taken to London and faced an
English jury in the famous old Bailey
court, of course, I was perfectly willing
to pay justice her due, and felt that I
had no right to protest, if I should re
ceive a sentence of even ten or fifteen
years, but when the Judge, Lord Archi
bald, hurled a sentence of imprisonment
for life at me 1 felt that justice was
weighing me in her balance with a pret
ty good effect. Now. in England a life
sentence means life with a big L. but I
thought that anything would be possible
if I only had courage to endure. I re
solved I would endure the peltings of the
pitiless storm I knew was ahead of me.
This I did with more or less fortitude for
over twenty years. I never lost my faith
that there was corn and wine in Egypt
for me still.""
George Bidwell was caught In France
ami Austin Bidwell in Cuba. They were
tried and given life sentences with their
two confederates. After twenty years
they were released.
in those extravagant .times, when the
market was overstocked, bales and casrs
of valuable goods were used to form side
walk?. The contents speedily rotted and
the packages sank out of sight in the .
mud to take their place in forming the
foundations of a great city.
Many large ships, being unable to find
crews, were monred to the shore anjl
turned into hotels nr busings establish
ments. They, too, When their time came, .
rotted and sank into the mud. Even to
day, when driving, piles for a foundation,,
it is no uncommon thing for the contract
ors to find their progress stopped* by the
timbers of some old ship, buried man/
feet below the surface.
It can easily be understood how this
mass of decomposing material has allow
ed Itself to be compressed by the weights
placed upon It. Then, until the seawall
was built in 1877, there was nothing to
prevent the waves of the bay washing
out the filling, just as they are doing to
day east of Mission, where the protecting:
wall is still lacking. Even as it is, the
seawall does not form an absolutely per
fect barrier. The tide finds its way
through the Interstices of the loosely laid
stones and bears seaward each day a
certain proportion of mud. The concrete
wall erected opposite the new ferry depot
affords a better safeguard against the
action of the waves, and if this were the
only source of trouble would undoubtedly
check the subsidence of Market street.
But we must go still deeper to get at
the root of the evil. It is not merely the
loosely made ground on top which is at
fault. The trouble ' is that this filling,
unsatisfactory though it be, has no better
foundation to rest upon than soft mud.
It is an actual fact that the bedrock
underlying San Francisco Bay has never
been struck. The metamorphic sandstone
which crops out on the side of Telegraph
Hill and rises again on the other side of
the harbor dips sharply under the water.
For countless centuries each rapidly run
ning tide has been bringing down its load
of mud from the upper reaches of the bay
nnd depositing it along the beaches
wherever the contour of the land checked
for a while the rapid rush at jjhe current.
The Terba Buena indentation must have
receiv( d Its full share of this sediment,
soft, blue, greasy stuff, for no man with
certainty knows its depth.
Exports differ on the point. Baron T*h
lig thinks the bedrock may be anywhere
from two to three hundred feet below the
city level. ""We cannot say accurately,""
he explains, ""for as far as we ha.ye yet
gone down, we have struck nothing but
blue mud, gradually stiffening into blue'
clay. In 1572, when taking a survey for
the proposed seawall, we made a horing
two hundred .feet, but never encountered
rock. In 1890, at another place on the
water front, we went down 150 feet with
the same result.""
The contractors, who are always busy
driving piles on the water front, can give,
in spite of all tneir experience, no more
definite Information. ""We have nevet
struck bedrock anywhere,"" said a member
oi one of the largest tlrms engaged in this
business. ""The longest piles we have ever
driven have gone to a depth of eighty-five""
feet, but we have never encountered any
thing but mud.""
The experience gained in building the
seawall illustrates the unstable character
of the ground. To make this wall it was
necessary to dump huge scowloads of
rock into the bay, and to keep on dump
ing until the stone at last ceased to Set
tle. Often at the end of the day's, work
the contractors would leave the wall
standing several feet out of the water..-
When they returned to labor in the mom- .
ing the loosely piled rock would have
sunk to a depth of twelve or fifteen feet,.
In one instance a strip of the wall about
300 feet in length sunk bodily out of sight,
and the whole work had to be recom
menced. However, patience and an inex
haustible supply of rock triumphed in the
end, the mud was compressed until it
would yield on longer and the seawall
sank to its final bearings.
No man can say when the period of sub
sidence will cease— when the underlying
clay shall have been so firmly compressed
that it will yield no more.
Meanwhile, unless some change happens,
it may become necessary to follow the
example of Chicago, and to bodily raise
this low lying portion of the city to a safe
height above high water mark.
Glowworms are much more brilliant
when a storm Is coming than at other
seasons. Like many other mysteries of
Nature, this curious circumstance haa
never been explained.

JEANETTE HOME RICH WITH
SPOILS FROM THE ARCTIC
THE steam whaler Jeanette arrived from the Arc
tic yesterday, after the most successful cruise of
the season. She left here last January, but dur
ing the interval the crew succeeded in taking
eighteen whales, or a few less than all the rest of
the fleet combined. The eighteen leviathans yielded
34,000 pounds of whalebone, valued at. in round figures,
?■••""""'■■""""
The Jeanette was docked as quickly as possible and
the cargo unloaded. The whalebone will be shipped Bast
at once, and from New York will go to France. At
Lyons and oth»r French manufacturing centers it will
be made Into threads and joined' with silk will be turned
Into the stiff silk dresses that come to San Francisco
and cost so much money.
Captain Newth of the Jeanette reports the Karluk
with 4, Thrasher 4, Bowhead 5, Mermaid 2, Alaska 1.
William Baylies 2, Belvedere 3 and Alexander 2 whales.
Captain Mckenna in the F.-arless did not catch a whale.
He is going to winter at Herschel Island, while the
Grampus, Balaena and Narwhal will winter at Capo
Bathurst. The Thrasher has lost a half of one of the
blades of her propeller and will be a few days late mak
ing port. The rest of the fleet is now hourly expected.
FraJik Smith, one of the crew of the Jeanette, died in
August last of consumption and was buried at sea.

Jacob Oppenheimer, the (Tend, who

RIGHTS OF THE WIFE.
Riverside Conspiracy Case in the Su-
preme Court.
Mrs Eleanor Hart of Riverside County
brought an action fipnlnst her husband,
Elton Hart, and Katherlne A. Church to
compel the cancellation and surrender of
a mortgaKe In the sum of $T.ipi'«O upon the
plaintiff's homestead. The circumstances
of the trouble are peculiar. In 1^94 Hart
took the Church woman to his home and,
according to the complaint, bestowed upon
her the attentions dne only to the wife.
Mrs. Hart charges that while she was
sorely troubled in mind and ill Hart and
the Church woman, by threats and in
timidation, compelled her to sign a note
for SSOOO and secure the payment thereof
by K'vinp a mortgage on the homestead.
In the lower court Mrs. Hart won, but in
the- higher court, to which the oa.«e was
appealed, the judgment was modified. The
Buperior Court sustained the part direct
ing the caii'-ellatlon of the mortgage, on
the ground that the instrument was not
executed Jointly and concurrently by the
husb.-ind and wife. The husband did
Blgn and acknowledge a statement that he
Joined with his wife in incumbering the
property, but not until five months after
she had been induced to sign the mort
gage. This made it Invalid, because it did
not comply with the code. As the com
plaint did not aek for the rescission and
cancellation of the note, which the lower
court directed, this part of the first order
was reversed.

daughter-in-law and three children, all died of the mal
ady Inside of five days. Nothing can be done to stay th»
ravages of the disease, and as soon as a native Is taken
sick he simply gives up and dies in a few days.
The Ksquimaux at Cape Prince of Wales discovered
gold In large quantities in one of the creeks. They tried
to keep the secret to themselves, but it leaked out and
there was a rush of gold hunters to the place when the
Jeanette was there. Captain Newth also says that he
heard that both placer and quartz mines had been dis
covered in Kotzebue Sound. The whaling bark Ala-ska
is fitted out for carrying passengers, and Captain Cogan
intends stopping at Cape Nome on the way down to
bring down all the miners who want to come home.
The Jeanette Is now at Howard street wharf, but as
soon as she is discharged will go over to Oakland Creek
and lie up for the winter. In the spring she will go
back to the Arctic. This year Captain Newth was first
to the eastward and on the home, run was first to the
westward. To this fact he attributes his good luck, and
next year will try the same tactics.
said, the convict immediately compiled
with the order. Warden Agulrre was sent
for and asked Oppenheimer what he had
done such a thing for.
""Well,"" was the surly reply, ""if I tell
you you will know as much about it as
I do.""
The Warden sent Jones for a strait-
Jacket without any loss of time and placed
the intractable criminal in this Instru
ment of torture. At 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon Oppenhelmer's spirit was
broken sufficiently that he sent for
Aguirre and declared that his craving for
a smoke was more than he could endure
and he had taken that means of securing
It. Ajtulrre laughed and asked Oppen
heimer If he expected to smoke the mat

broke down completely and confessed to
the Warden a tale of Intended murder
and escape so terrible In circumstantial
detnll that even the head of the prison,
with all his dealings with the criminal
class, was dumfounded. After tilling
about taking the inner pages out of the
religious paper and making the tube Op

A ""Fake"" Printer.
The police were notified yesterday by
the secretary' of the Typographical Union
that a man was soliciting money for the
support ""f the union. The man Is a fraud,
as the union does not require to solicit
funds. He Is described as about 30 year?
of ape. medium height and has v black
mustache.
You never have a head In the morning from
drinking Jesae Moors' ""AA"" whiskey. Try It.
, fierce we were to huddle against the doors
! of our cells and yell 'flre,' to get Jones to
! come and unlock the cells In order to save
us from being cooked alive. We felt con
fident that In the flurry and excitement
attending the affair his humane feelings
would cause him to do this. Then we
would have waited till three or four of
the 'boys' were released and fallen upon
him and killed him, or rendered him in
sensible at least. Afterward he would I
have been placed in a cell, the fires ex- ;
tlnguished, tho others released with the j
keys which we knew Jones carried, and j
when Harwell returned it would have j
been an easy matter to put him out of tho
way.
""When It was very dark we would have
slipped nut quietly and waylaid Sergeant
of the Night Watch Ellis and his seven !
men separately and knocked them out
with bludgeons. Securing their clothes
nnd weapons and keys we would have re
leased a few of the most desperate prls
! oners and set flre to one of the buildings
;In the southern part of the yard. When
the flre blazed high and the guards on
; the wall ran around there we would have
instructed the mon last released to rush
; over the west wall, and while the guards
I were shooting at th«m we could have
i easily escaped unnoticed over the north
wall.""
Oppenholmer was asked if he did not
1 realize that some of the men going over
the west wall . would be killed. He
laughed ajid said the convicts in the in
' corrigible ward had a club of common
I commiseration and sympathy formed and
didn't care for the rabble of prisoners
anyway.
Oppenhelmer was released from his
straightjaoket last night and with tears in
his eyes said he would make no more at
tempts to escape. He said he had all he
wanted of Aguirro and should have taken
j warning from the case of ""Sir"" Harry
Cooper and Morroll. All the other convicts
j in the incorrigible ward denied that they
I were concerned in the plan, and as there
was no proof that they were except the
word of Opponheimer they were allowed
to go unpunished.
""Here- is a case,"" assertod Warden
Agulrre last evening, ""where these incor
! rlgll'le follows have tried to escape within
; a fow weeks of the time when two of their
i number were punished .severely for the
j very same thing. Now 'Sir' Harry, Mor
! rell and Oppenheimer have all been quiet-
I ed and will stay that way. With these
restless spirits rendered tractable, we an
ticipate no further trouble In that quarter.
Yet there are people who rail against the
Incorrigible cell system, and would have
such convicts as those permitted to roam
about where their chances of working evil
would be Increased a hundred fold.""
Captains Russell and Edgar both be
lieve there will be no more trouble In the
Incorrigible ward for some time to come.
Guard Jones, to whose vigilance Is por-
I haps dup the lives of ton mon, has been
: tlirinkod by tho Warden and by Prison Di
rector Wllkins for his devotion to duty.

DARING CHINESE
BURGLAR LOCKED
IN THE TANKS
Ex-Convict Ah Loui
Captured.
POLICE NO LONGER PUZZLED
Taken Into Custody After Making
an Unsuccessful Attempt to En-
ter a Fashionable Resi
dence.
Safely locked In the tanks at the City
Prison is Ah Loui, a desperate Chinaman
whom the police believe is .responsible for
the series of daring burglaries that have
been committed in the Western Addition
during the last few nights. The wily
Mongol was arrested last night by Special
Policeman Dailey and Policeman Whelan,
Just as he was leaving a fashionable resi
dence on California street, where he had
made an unsuccessful attempt to force
the front door open with a jimmy.
Ever since' the series of burglaries that
have puzzled the police were successfully
committed the officers in the western por
tion of the city were given orders to be
especially vigilant and arrest all suspi
cious characters seen hovering about their
beats. Shortly after 8 o'clock last even
ing Special Dailey and Officer VVhelaji no
ticed the Chinaman skulking in the dark
shadows close to the edge of the sidewalk
and they stood across the street and
watched him.
In a few moments Ah Loui disappeared
up the stairs of a residence close by and
remained at the door several minutes.
Then- he came hastily downstairs and
started to run up the street. The officers
chase and soon captured him. When
! placed under arrest the Chinaman became
j ugly and defiant and protested that his
only object In visiting the house was to
sell lottery tickets. As an evidence of
good faith the prisoner reached under his
blouse and drew forth a wad of Chinese
lottery tickets.
Policeman Whelan left Ah Loui in
charge of the special officer and went
back to the residence the Chinaman at
tempted to enter. There he ascertained
that he had not rung the bell but at
tempted to force the door v.-lth a jimmy.
The occupants of the house heard the
sounds and started toward the front door,
thus frightening him off.
The prisoner was taken to the f'ltv
Prison, where he was thoroughly searched
by his captors, assisted by several detec
tives from the upper office. On his per
i son were found a complete set of burg
! lars' tools, including a Jimmy and a skele
ton key of unusually fin^ make. The key
was concealed in the sole of his stocking.
During the searching process one of the
detectives identified Ah Loui as an ex
convict and a clever Chinese crook wno
has given the police considerable trouble
in the past.
SUSPECTED DIAMOND
THIEF IN THE TANKS
Ah Sing, a Chinese Cook, Departs
With Mrs. Carleton Crane's
Gems.
Ah Sing, an alleged diamond thief, who
professes to be a Chinese cook, was ar
rested last night by Detectives Wren and
Dlnan and taken to the City Prison,
where he was placed in the tanks;
Carleton C. Crane, the well-known local
agent for the Vanderbllt lines, had abso
lute faith In Ah Sing's honesty and ability
and last Monday employed the. Chinaman
as a cook and sent him to his country
residence at Verona, near Nlles.
On Wednesday Ah Sing complained of
feeling 111 and he asked permission to
come to the city.
Mrs. Crane granted the desired pprmlp
slon. When dinner time arrived and Ah
Sing did not return, Mrs. Crane became
suspicious and began to search the house
to sf-e if anything was missing. She went
to her Jewel case first and found that six
elegant and costly diamond rings had been
stolen.
The matter was at once reported to
Chief T^ees and he detailed Detectives
Wren and Dlnan to apprehend Ah Sing.
The Chinaman was found hiding In a
Chinese store pn Commercial street, but
the stolen Jewelry was not found on his
person.

cago athletic clubs, and from such other
clubs as may provide the material we
desire, will be represented. This will be
followed by a revival of wrestling, catch
as-catch-can style, on the same lines as
the other.
""The internal changes in the Olympic
Club will be the building of a ball court
and a rearrangement and remodeling of
the bathing facilities. What I particu
larly desire is the building up of the juve
nile and Junior classes, which, have al
ready begun to take a spurt; and the in
creasing in every direction of the personal
comfort of members. In order that every
member shall feel he is getting the full
value of his investment the present board
of directors aspire to give frequent ath
letic exhibitions.
""In regard to the tone of the club, it
has Improved very materially of late, as
the board of directors have determined to
retain in the club only those who can be
have as gentlemen. The increase in dues
caused a number of resignations, but the
gap has been more than filled by the re
turn of old and the election of new
members. Already the classes are very
much enlarged. The salaries of the teach
ers have been Increased and their hours
of labor largely extended. The club is on
the up-grade and every one interested in
the advance of athletics on this coast is
helping It on.""
A great part of Mr. Harrison's time in
New York was spent on board the Erin,
as the guest of Sir Thomas Llpton. Of
Sir Thomas he said:
""He is a generous host, affable compan
ion and keen sportsman. One of his many
good qualities is that he never forgets his
friends. Almost the first words he said
when I met him were to inquire after his
old friend, Mr. Pollok of the Palace Hotel,
to whom he desired to be warmly remem
bered.""
In company with some of Sir Thomas'
guests. Mr. Harrison viewed the great
naval parade in Dewey's honor. He pro
fessed himself greatly disappointed, as it
did not approach in spectacular effect the
recent one in San Francisco; neither
could the Illuminations, on the night of
the land parade, compare with those

FIRE IN MANUFACTURING
CENTER CAUSES BIG LOSS
Three Firms Are Damaged by Flames
to the Extent of Nearly
$40,000.
Fire was discovered last night shortly
before 8 o'clock in the engineers' supply,
house of Plckthall & Co., 105 Fremont
street, between Mission and Howard'
streets. An alarm was sounded from box
261 by Special Officer Stanton, but before
the department arrived the fire had spread
to the Standard Machine Works .and
Brown & Nugent's wagon works.
The fire was a stubborn one to fight, and
not until after two hours of the hardest
work was it declared out. Owing to the
nature of the contents of the various
buildings considerable damage was done
by water. The total loss is estimated at
between $30,000 and $40,000.

TARIFF BEARS
ON CALIFORNIA
Australian Measure Puts
Tax on Products of
State.
Director Eugene Goodwin ?t the Pacific
Commercial Museum has received advices
of great importance to the commercial
community concerning the flV.st protective
tariff of the Australian federation. This
tariff has been approved by one branch
of the Australian Government, and al
ready under the Australian form of pro
cedure is in effect, although it has not
finally been adopted by the othsr branch.
At Newcastle, according to th« advices,
the retail houses have added thS duty to
the price of goods and are reaping a large
profit on the goods that were in stork.
The tariff afreets many classes of prod
ucts and manufactures in which are in
cluded products of California, as wine
brandy, flour, wheat, almonds, barley'
malt, peas, biscuits, blankets, boots and
shoes, canned fruits, currants, furniture
fuse, gloves, honey, hops, onions, pota
toes, salmon, etc.
Fabrics, iron manufactures, and indeed
all branches of industry in the United
States are concerned in ,tne measures pro
posed and partially adopted. New South
Wales, which has been practicaily a free
trade colony^ is bitterly opposing the pro
tective tariff. On the whole, the tariff
rates have been raised even above those
that Victoria has had in force.
Cotton piece goods are charged 10 ncr
cent. Hats carry a duty of 10 shillings
per dozen and 15 per cent ad valorem
bottled ale and stout 4 shillings 8 pence
per case. Ten per cent is added to malt
of which Australia supplies only about
one-third of its consumption. The duty
on wheat is 6 pence per cental, equal to
nearly 11 pence per bushel, and 1 nence
per pound on flour gives, according to the
estimates of Australian millers, a protec
tion equal to £4 16s 8d per ton. A tabu
lation appears in the last number of the
Sydney Morning Herald to reach this
country, which shows the tariff of the
commonwealth as compared to the old
tariffs of the several colonies, Western
Australia being alone excepted because
in that colony the tariff that heretofore
was in force will under the constitution
be retained for a period.
Duties on California Products.
From the tabulation some figures are '
taken at random, indicating the frenera'
tenor of the whole, and having esDeci-i
reference to the products in wnlch Cali
fornia is particularly concerned. Tho
duties imposed in these instances are as
follows:
Almonds, 3d per pound; bacon. 3d p«r pound
barley. 13 6d per cental; peas, Is 6d per cen ""
tal; biscuit*, l^d per pound: brandy 14s r*r
gallon; currants, 2d per pound: flour, 2a 6d r»-r '
cental; uloves 20 per cent; blankets. 2u per '¦
cent; bottled, fruits, 3s uer dozen; bolts and '
nut?, 20 per cent; fruit, canfced, 3s per dozen '
lui-nlture. 20 per cent; honey. 2d per pound 1
hops, .6d per pound; onions, is pw 100 pounds :

manufactured. 3s 6d per pound; wheat is Bd I
per 100 pounds; wine, sparklns. 12s- wine !
other than sparkling;, Ss.
Within the past few days merchants
have been anxiously inquiring at the Pa
cific Commercial Museum concerniiv tho \
effect of the new tariff. The above fig
ures convey the first authentic informa
tion that is procurable on that interest
ing point. All the Australian colonies
are included in The commonwealth with
the exception of New Zealand. -For the
first time, with the exception of New-
Zealand, the colonies or States, as they
now are called, will have free trade with
one another. While the peonle of N^w
South Wales are protesting ""and hoping
to change the tariff in some particulars
the free trade provision between the colo
nies is actually in force. Against New-
Zealand, however, the new tariff runs.
The effect will be that large quantities of
New Zealand produce will be shut out
from the commonwealth. The Wellington
(New Zealand) Post of recent issue says
""lf the tariff proposals are adopted New

the near future.""
Machinery Is Taxed.
American agricultural machinery is
heavily taxed. Tea has to carry 20 per
cent ad valorem in addition to 2 pence
per pound. Those who are favoring the
final adoption of the tariff are urging
that it will tend to build up the manufac
turing industries of Australia, which has
coal, iron, lumber, wooT. etc.. at home
Some additional light is gained from an
editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald,
a part of which is as follows:
It ia complained that the tariff offers the
manufacturers of cement a practical bonus of
125 per cent over the imported article. Plas
ter of parts shows 100 per cent, structural steel
about 45 per cent, wire 33 1-3 per cent, horse
shoe nails 50 per cent more than the present
price. Those who buy medium grrade boots
must pay 3s 6d more than they have been
accustomed to and 2s 6d more for ladies' foot-
Kear. The consumer of kerosene must be pre
pared to meet a demand of 50 per cent more
than before, and the poorer buyer of hats will
find the cost raised from 60 to 120 per cent
Mrs. Reddy Demands Accounting.
Mrs. Caroline S. Reddy, wfdow of Ed
ward Reddy. is not satisfied with the
methods of Mrs. Emily Reddy, widow of
Patrick Reddy, as executrix of the Reddy
estate, and has applied to Judge Coffey
for an accounting. She alleges that Mrs.
Emily Reddy has never accounted to her
for the moneys she has received from the
estate, and that she is about to dispose
of part of the estate.

RECOGNITION FOB BRAVERY
Urge Fire Commission to Reward
Frank Gorman for Rescuing
a Young Girl.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee yester
day referred to the Fire Commission th«
communication of Chief Sullivan of the
Fire Department, recommending for suit
able recognition the heroic act of Frank
Gorman in saving Miss Nellie Healey
from a fire at 244 Stevenson street.
The committee recommends that Gor
man be rewarded in such manner as will
seem proper by the Fire Commission.
While appreciating the bravery shown by
Gorman in risking his life to save another,
the committee regrets that it has no
power to reward the young man. How
ever, it gives its hearty approval to any
token that the Fire Commission may see
fit to give him.

san francisco call.,['San Francisco'],1903-09-09,"themselves to realize that the men who
flocked to California in '49 and subse
quently were the ones who did real yeo
man work in laying the foundations of the
great commonwealth and that it would be
the later Influx of settlers who would far
outshadow the few who had come before
in the light of subsequent history.
After much opposition, the early settlers
at last gave way and in July, 1853, the
constitution was so amended that all
those who had come to California prior to
January 1, 1S50, could be admitted Into the
society. But the distinction yet remained
that the early settlers, or those who had
come to the West before '49, should con
stitute a class, with class privileges. As
a result of the removal of the barrier
against the men of '49 the membership of
the society was doubled before the end of
the year.
Daring Vigilantes Led by
William T. Coleman
Against Crime.
THE part played by the Pioneers in
the social life of the fifties cannot
be overestimated. In those days of
restless money getting, when San
Francisco was, at its best, a very
poor place in which to live,
when gamblers and murderers elbowed
respectable citizens into the gutters, and
crime in all its hideous shapes, was rife,
the fraternal spirit of the society acted as
a counter-irritant to the demoralizing in
fluences of the time. To the man, wearied
by the hurry and confusion of early San
Francisco life and sick for the noble com
radeship of a good man the society of
fered the safest refuge. . While gambling
dens and dance balls were nightly offer
ing their tawdry attractions to the young
man, wearied by the day's tail, the rooms
of the society were the only 'safe haven.
L. Folsom; assistant recording secretary,
J. C. L. Wadsworth; corresponding sec
retary, Edwin Bryant. To realize the
part which these men played in the early
history of California we have only to re
flect that the names of four of them have
been perpetuated by being applied to four
of the streets of San Francisco. Bry
ant afterward became the author of one
of the earliest books on California life,
entitled ""What I Saw In California.""
From its very inception the society
came to command the respect and honor
of all. In the monster procession which
was held to celebrate the news of the re
ception of California into the Union, Colo
nel Stevenson, the grand marshal, placed
the Pioneers In the fore-front of the line.
Again, at the occasion of its first public
celebration, the society marched through
the streets and afterward kept open
house, entertaining State and city digni
taries with a lavish hand. Well could the
society claim for itself pre-eminence at
that time. Among 1 the first members_were
the following noted men in subsequent his
tory: General Henry W. Halleck, Gen
eral William T. Sherman, General John C.
Fremont, General John W. Geary, General
George A. Stoneman, General Henry M.
Naglee, General Joseph Hooker, Commo
dore Robert F. Stockton,* Commodore Sel
fridge—all men who either had become
famous or were destined to achieve great
mark in the Civil War.
As the society grew older, it began to
become evident that if its membership
were confined strictly to the men who
came to California before 1849 it would
soon cease altogether, so the movement
to Incorporate members who were in the
land of gold before California was admit
ted to the Union began to be agitated.
Strange to us of the present day appears
the jealousy which was maintained by the
first settlers against the argonauts. In
their narrowness they could not bring
Members of California Society of Pioneers, Who Guided Organization in th? Early Days.
Men of Arcadian Period
Are First to Bind
Fraternal Tie.
*«""^UT for the first Inspiration of the
A^ Bociety we must look farther back
J*J than the days of gold; we
must consider the very first pio
neers who drifted down upon Cal
ifornia when it was yet a dreamy
pravlnce of old Mexico. Before '43 there
were stirring events which tended to weld
the first American settlers Into a compact
body with a common cause and common
needs. In the days of the Bear Flag revo
lu'.ion at Sonoma, which are touched upon
in another part of this paper, and in the
fierce heat of the ensuing conquest of
California by General John C. Fremont
and .ommodore R- F. Stockton, the men
banded together in support of their new
homes and their mother country far over
the mountains sowed the seed from which
was to cpring the great society. To the
very earliest blood of the society, organ
lz< i by these earliest settlers, there was
infused the new stock of the argonauts.
From these two branches sprang the or
pnnization which was to do so much in
support of the patriotic sentiments of
the later generation— the native children
of California.
Among those who were the very earliest
Fettlers in the territory of California were
two who did much to inaugurate the so
ciety, Samuel Brannan and Colonel Jona
than D. Stevenson. Brannan had come
around the Horn in 1846 with the Mormon
colony which had Intended to find In Cali
fornia an abiding place for the Saints, so
recently driven out of their city of Nau
voo. Illinois. The Mormons found that
the settlers from the East had already
pre-empted the country, but they made
the best of It and stayed in the new ter-
Thus, with their work wel' established,
the Pioneers who yet remain look back
upon that which has been of their doing
and justly feel that they have tried to
perform their full measure of private
duty and oubllc benefaction, and leave
a fair measure of good to the new Cali
fornia whose growth has been so greatly
stimulated by. their effort*,
and have to call upon the assistance of
their brothers. As an example of what
Is done by the relief fund the figures of
disbursements for'the last two years
may be cited.
The total disbursements for relief In
1901-02 were $10,234. equal to an average
payment of JS55. For 1902-03 th» total
relief offered amounted to $11,320 90, mak
ing an average monthly payment of 1344.
Forty-seven worthy beneficiaries claimed
assistance in 1901-02, and In the succeed
ing year the number was forty.
The finances of the Pioneers, thanks
to the generosity of James Lick and the
perfect management of the funds since
the time of the society's lnceotlon. are
In such a condition as to warrant the gen
erous assistance given members in dis
tress. As the result of wisely invested In
terests, the assets of the society were
valued at $335,843 06 at the last report of
the treasurer. With such a firm founda
tion, the organization Is In a position to
rival many benevolent and fraternal so
cieties with far greater membership.
In the museum of Pioneer Hall there is
a rich store of historical material in the
shape of valuable documents, quaint me
mentoes of the early days and pictures
of prominent personages of lone ago.
Along the walls of the assembly hall and
museum are hung the engravings of

Commodore Stockton's proclamation
upon the raising of the Stars
and Stripes over California soil
is also among the relics treas
ured by the Pioneers. There are
clippings from old newspapers announc
ing the sailing of steamers to the land of
gold, faded pictures of familiar scenes in
the early history of the city, the bell of
the Monumental Fire Company, which,
used to sound the alarms of the Vigi
lantes, and even the battered plug hat
and rusty sword of ""Norton, Emperor by
the grace of God."" A visit to Pioneer
Hall Is in itself a full course in the his
tory of our State.
completion of the new structure, the so
ciety entered Into its new home with one
of the most brilliant social functions of
the year. The first important step which
was made after the new building had
been put into use was the creation of a
relief fund. Already some of the earlier
members were becoming infirm with age
and many were broken in fortune. With
the generous gift of 1500, made by Rob
ert J. Tiffany, the relief fund soon grew
to the $10,000 mark and since that time
has been kept at that sum, notwithstand
ing the many deeds of charity which have
been done by the society for the benefit
of needy members.
On October 3. 1S73. Lick made another
generous gift to the society of which ; he
was an enthusiastic rr-ember. This was
a deed to the magnificent site where Pio
neer Hall now stands on the corner of
Fourth and Stevenson streets. Lick had
desired that his name and the fame of
the organization should be perpetuated
by a building which should be a lasting
monument to both. In September,
1S73, Lick made the Pioneers one of his
residuary legatees In the deed of trust
through which the final disposition of his
great estate was to be made. By these
two benefices that capitalist and philan
thropist put the Society of California
Pioneers in the position of being one of
the richest social organizations of the
State.
Housed in Magnificent
Quarters, Destiny Is
Fulfilled.
Y ICK died on September 30, 1876.
/ and great trouble was destined to
J-^ surround the munificent gift which
he had made before the society could
derive any benefit therefrom. When
In 18S2 the society had not yet
received Its benefice from the ""Lick
Trust,"", which was closing up the es
tate, a committee was appointed to in
vestigate the affairs of the executors and
report to the society. This committee
made some sensational charges against
the executors of the estate and a remark
able degree of excitement was aroused
both in the society and by the public
press. * But it was fairly shown to the
society that all the time that the Lick
benefice was tied up in the estate It was
gathering larger and larger accretions of
wealth. When the"" estate was finally set
tled in 1S0C, the cash benefit to the so
ciety amounted to JG04.65J OS.
Before the Lick estate had been di
vided, the agitation for a . new Pioneer
Hall, to be erected on the lot which Lick
had presented to the society in 1873. was
commenced. After considerable opposi
tion, a permanent building committee was
selected and after first relncorporatlng
under, the new constitution, work upon
the present structure, was commenced.
The cornerstone was laid on September
7, 1S84. and in due season the society en
tered into its^ permanent home. Since
that time the old Pioneers have been loy
ally standing shoulder to shoulder, clos
ing the gaps as they are made by the
hand of the reaper and resolutely foster
ing the same old spirit which obtained
when first the young Pioneers marched
at the head of the procession on the first
Admission Day celebration.
The purposes for which the Society of
California> Pioneers was formed and is
maintained are thus succinctly stated In
its constitution:
""The society is designed to be a moral,
should take a number and thus sink his
personality for the sake of the secrecy
necessary to successfully carry on the
work which had to be done. >
Immediately the question arose: ""Who
shall be number one?"" At once Coleman
-was singled out by his associates. Cole
man vainly tried to refuse, but at last
was forced to acquiesce. Thus was the
strength of the Pioneers represented in
""No. 1"" of the famous Vigilance Com
mittee of ""56.
At this time a man was elevated to the
presidency of the society whose name is
Inseparable from the early history of
California. This was Thomas O. Larkln.
He had come to Monterey in 1S32, being
therefore one of the very first Americans
to settle in California. As consular agent
of the United States during the time when
our Government was making manifest
plans to lay hold of the western coast, he
did much. He was a worthy representa
tive of the old order of things among the
pioneers.
During Larkin's presidency the entire
board of directors was made up of forty,
niners, he being the sole representative of
the old conservative first settlers. From
this time forward, the younger branch of
the society remained in control almost to
the total exclusion of the old guard.
The first headquarters of the society
were In the old Bella Union building, on
Washington street, near Kearny. This
was then the center of the business dis
trict of the city, and the building in
which the Pioneers lodged was considered
a remarkably fine one. In 1860, however,
James Lick made his first gift to the so
ciety in the form of a lot on Montgomery
street, near Pacific, where now can be
still seen a dingy old hall, at present the
headquarters of a livery stable, with the
legend, Pioneers, across its stone front.
As a result of one of San Francisco's
great .fires, , which ruined hundreds and
paralyzed business temporarily, the So
ciety of -California Pioneers languished
during the early '60's. But through the
earnest endeavors of O. P. Sutton, Wll
lard B. Farwell and William R. Wheaton,
interest was revived in 1S62. By the plan
of having numerous individuals take out
life memberships, a fund of $3000 toward
the erection of the building upon the lot
donated by Lick was accumulated.
Through Gifts of James
/Lick, Society Gains
Palatial Home.
rllE society was then forced to de
vise means for placing a mortgage
on its property in order that
more building funds could be raised.
No sufficient authority for such ac
tion being vested in the officers,
it became necessary to have an act
passed by the Legislature bestowing upon
the president, ' secretary and board of di
rectors the necessary authority for such
a step. Wlllard B. Farwell, who was at
this time one of those most active in com
pleting the reorganization of the society,
' secured the passage of the act, and the
mortgage was given. To provide against
possible contingencies of a like nature,
the society drew up articles of Incorpora
tion and on January 28, 1S63, they were
filed and the organization thus started on
a firm legal basis. •"". - rt •
With all obstructions thus removed, the
new .-building was started, the corner
stone being laid on July 7, 1863. Upon the

under the constitution of the
new society were: President,
William D. M. Howard; vice presi

It was at this meeting at an Iron ware
house on Montgomery street then, that
the California Society of Pioneers was or
ganized. On September 27, when the con
stitution and by-laws had been drawn up,
the announcement of the existence of the
rocie-ty was made in the morning papers.
The Herald commented upon the an
nouncement in the following editorial:
""We have seen no movement In our
midst so fraught with interest as the
formation of the California Society of
Pioneers. Most of our readers are proba
bly unaware that the old settlers have
united In a society with the view of prc
feiving a record of the various historical
incidents connected with the early colon
ization of California by Americans, which

such a communism as Is likely to be
brought about through this organization.
""It is expected all old pioneers and res
idents of three years and upward will

rltory. Brannan started the first paper,
Uie ""California Star."" and through Its
columns did much to bring California be
fore the eyes of the Eastern states. His
friend and co-worker. Colonel Stevenson,
had come across the continent with the
famous Stevenson regiment just at the
close of the Mexican War and had set
tled at San Francisco, there to become
later a prominent figure in the early his
tory of the State.
The steamship California, which ar
rived at San Francisco on August 23. 1850,
brought news of the death of President
Taylor. By W. D. M. Howard, J. C. I*
Wadpworth and Brannan it was proposed
to call together all of the ""old residents""
of the vicinity to pay due respect to hia
memory. This call did not include any
of the argonauts who had come in '49, for
the earlier pioneers were very jealous of
their distinction as such and looked upon
the men of the gold rush, if not In th*
light of intruders, certainly not worthy
of the titles of pioneers. Accordingly the
following notice appeared in Brannan's
paper of August 30:
""The early pioneers of California are-
requested to call at the Iron Warehouse of
Howard & Mellus, on Montgomery street,
en Saturday evening, 31st of August, at

To-day at our fifty-third birthday of the

that great majority of their Pioneer band
which has now gone whither they them

When In the fevered days of the gold
rush, men poured into California through
every mountain pass end on every in
coming vessel, there was born In them
a generous spirit of fellowship and rough
fraternal affection. The perils of the
plains ar.d of the snowy Sierras, the many
hardships of the mining camps where
often men were forced to band themselves
together for protection against lawless
ness, the open handed generosity of those
fortunate ones who found themselves sud
denly made rich— all these influences in
evitably drew men into a closer bond of
fellowship. A mutual pride of the State
was felt among them; a mutual desire
to build well the foundations for the
great future impelled them; a mutual
respect for one another united them.
Forty-three years ago to-day these sim
ple yet sublimely touching words were
uttered by on* of the strong: men of the
Society of California Pioneers, Edmund
Randolph. The members of the society
had gathered to celebrate the tenth an
niversary of the admission of California

i THE SAN FKANCJSCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, ~1903.
It was at this period in the .history
of the Pioneers that the sterling
worth of the members of the society
was demonstrated in an hour of nead.
When San Francisco was overrun with
murderers. and blacklegs and justice was
blinded by the machinations of desperate
and unprincipled politicians, the Vigilance
Committee sprang into existence. At its
head was William T. Coleman, a leader
among the Pioneers. Among its members
were numbered over a hundred Pioneers
who enrolled themselves gladly to serve
the city in its hour of need.
In 1851 when the Vigilantes were first
organized, Coleman became a member of
the executive committee. When ' James
Stuart, arrested for the assault committed
upon an innocent' storekeeper, was tried
by the Vigilantes, Coleman acted as pros
ecuting attorney. When the organization
arrested John Jenkins, known as ""Sydney
Cove,"" Samuel Brannan and Coleman
were those most active> in securing for
the prisoner ' fair but speedy justice and
they had their hands on the rope which
swung the guilty man into eternity.
It was at the organization of the second
Vigilance Committee of 1856 that Coleman
and Brannan, together with Major John
W. Geary, all members of the Pioneer So
ciety, figured prominently. The incidents
of the first steps j toward . armed ! protec
tion showed that Coleman and bis asso
ciates were tried men and true. . .
When James King of William was shot
down in cold blood by James P.. Casey,
excitement raged to a fever heat and it
was Coleman' s steady hand which crystal
lized indignant protest into armed resist
ance,to rampant. lawlessness. The morn
ing after the murder the. members of the
old committee met at a hall on Sacra
mento, street near Leldesdorfr. Coleman
took the lead by penning a strong oath of
fealty to the cause to which they were
pledged. He suggested . that . each man

This is the first visit Colonel Greene
has paid to San Francisco for many
years. He expects to remain here for
about a week and . will then return \u25a0 to
New. York to continue a refutation of
the recent- stories circulated regarding his
mining properties, | and . which he claims
are jnothing but the spiteful work, of his
enemies, of whom the colonel' frankly ad
mits \u25a0he has a number. Of the t recent
attack made upon him by Thomas Law
son of ""Frenzied Finance"" fame, and his
meeting later with Lawson in Boston,
•where •It was \u25a0 expected the two men
would engage in a duel. Greene bad little
to .say yesterday further than to remark
that Lawson Is all right in a way, but
that some of, his broad charges of cbr
,ruption among the leading financiers of
the country have to be accepted with
some -degree of doubt.
It Is said by Colonel Greene's friends
that the fight being made by his enemies
In New Tork against him is for the pur
pose of depressing the stock of his Mexi
can properties and freezing him out of
the corporations. \u25a0•/:,» - -
Colonel W. C. . Greene, the . noted New
Tork mining promoter and president of
several bis enterprises In Mexico and
the south western part of this country,
among them - the Greene Consolidated
Copper Company, which has . recently
been the object of a. number of bitter
attacks . from various sources, arrived
here yesterday from the East and Is
staying at the Palace Hotel. Colonel
Greene was In Southern California sev
eral weeks ago, but went East on a. hur
ried business call, while his wife came
to: this city to await his return. Arriv
ing"" here yesterday- simultaneously with
the colonel, but from another direction,
\u25a0was A. C. . Bernard, manager of the
Gre«ne Copper Company. He has come
here to confer with Colonel Greene re
garding their business affairs.

f to Build Homes in City Parks
THE RtUcf Corporation yesterday decided to erect cottages and ten
ements In the city parks for such refugee* as can pay nominal
reut.^ The non-snpportlns will ' be removed to Ingleslde. The
omc fcr SRcd lndleents on the Almshouse tract will be made to ac
cemmodate 2000 Instead of 1000, as was originally planned.

,J f h ; executive committee of the Re
""rir,^°^? ratlon JTMterday formally re
'^,? , re solution of the old finance
V»r.V' m J \u25a0 t C whlch Provided that money
%^\f he rellef fund should be loaned
Uyildtrs of homes, and that the cor-
V(. ration should build houses and sell
mem on the installment plan. This ac-
UX>r\ v.as prefaced by a statement from
iucmas Magee. chairman of tire build
ir-? Qtpartwent of the corporation. The
Wtemcnt did not seem to surprise Mr.
-Magroe s associates in the least; in fact,
tncre is grave suspicion that the five
p<ntltraen of the executive committee
liiid already decided just what Mr. Ma
p-e's statement should contain. It is,
nuwtver. interesting: to the 40,000 ref
.Ugees who have become concerned as
to how they are to be housed this win
der, for it sets forth just what the Re
lief Corporation has decided to do for
tliem. The non-supporting are to be
stnt to the camp at Ingleside and
those who can pay nominal rent are to
be housed In cottages and tenements
,to be erected on city lands. There are
to be no loans made, no houses built to
be sold on the Installment plan and no
bonuses, other than those already ap
plied for. to be given intending build
ers. Mr. Magee's statement is as fol
lows:
MAGEE'S STATEMENT.
Within the last week the executive
committee has decided to make some
changes in the original plan of the old
relief committee.
In the original scheme It was pro
posed to buy land and build cottages,
selling them on the installment plan In
small installments covering five years.
For that purpose $2,500,000 was appro
priated. Five hundred thousand dol
lars was set aside at that time for
loans not to exceed $1000 to any one
person to build anywhere in the city
anS- county. Five hundred thousand
dollars was set aside for bonuses to be
given to landowners in the burned dis
trict, not more than one bonus to be
\u25a0griven to any one person and no bonus
to exceed $500 in amount and not to
represent more than one-third the cost
of the building. The number- of bo
nuses already applied for calls for
$320,803. The applications for loans
aggregate $198,734. These bonuses are
n-ow being paid, but no more applica
tions for bonuses will be received.
Instead of purchasing the land and
buil<si.ng cottages to sell the committee
has decided to build cheaper cottages
and tenements as well on all of the
public squares. The Park Commission
er's have granted the use of all public
parks \u2666 for one year for this purpose.
On these parks two and three room
cottages will be built, some by. con
tractors and some by the employes of
the land and building department.
""These cottagres will cost less than one
half the cottage a model of which
. f tands on Union Square. They can be
t-rected far more quickly, and a great
many more people can be accommo
dated with a great deal less money.
Tho committee in an interview to
day with Mr. Brittain of the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company was
quite pleased to find that he will fur
nish gas at cost, so that gas stoves and
gas lighting can be installed in the
tenements and cottages.
One reason for this change of plan
Wa« because of the discouraging price
*of real estate. Everywhere the com
mittee applied among the ou:s ie lands
. for property"" they were met with high
prices And indifferc-nt owners. Natur
ally to find cheap land they were driven
to the outskirts, where the people
\u25a0would have boen housed in points far
distant from their work and in too
many cases far from car lines. Because
-ef the high price of roal estate and
because of the more central locations
of the public parks and because it is
cheaper and Quicker for the people to
move' from a tent right into a house
alongside and because the house costs
less and could be erected more quickly
and because twice as- many people
could be housed for the same amount
of money, the committee decided to
. make this change.
\u25ba Those who applied for houses and
lots can now be accommodated in tem
porary two or three room cottages in
-central locations, where a nominal rent
will be charged for one year. None of
these cottag-es will be sold, as they are
being built on city property. ' After
August 17, l? 07, the tenants in these
hdmes must vacate and find permanent
' homes elsewhere for themselves.
CORPORATION IX DOUBT.
The committee also doubted Its right
as trustees of the relief fund to buy
land and soli to the people on the in
stallment plan. The work of the com
mittee would have continued indefinite
ly under such a plan and would have
aroused a great deal of criticism. They
also doubted the wisdom of making
loans and charging interest on a fund
that •was sent to them to be distributed
to the people for immediate relief. It
is now their purpose to distribute this
money as fast as possible in the best
manner possible to accommodate and
make comfortable the greatest number
of people. ""We have 40,000 people to
provide for.
When the applications for loans were
made the savings banks were not Jend-
Jng, but since then they have resumed
.their normal business and are now
lending in small amounts to just the
class of people who have applied to
the committee.
WORK AT INGLESIDE.
A large force of men is now at. work
at Ingleside laying sewers and remod
rling the buildings there for the ac
commodation of 4000 people. Ingleside
Will' be reserved for those who are de
pendent upon the committee for food
and shelter for the next year and will
be the only free camp. Those who can
pay nominal rent will find two and
three room apartment tenements In
the downtown districts and two and
three room cottages scattered all over
the parks which are now occupied by
tejijs. The first of the tenement-houses
is now half up on South Park. Over
1000 people can secure homes there.
The Griffith estate has very kindly
offered their corner on Harrison street
and Stanley place to the relief fund
for two years for the erection of such
tenements. They propose to rive this
corner to the city to be used for park
purposes, but pending the transfer to
the city they have given this corner
free to the reHef committee for the
erection of apartments.
Originally tne home for-the aged and
infirm was laid out on the almsliouse
.tract to accommodate 1000 people. This
building lias been <*>übled in size and
will accommodate 2000. The founda
tions are now being laid for that struc-

changes in the buildings at Ingleside
and to proceed with the building of the
home for the aged at the almshouse

It is expected that nearly $1,000,000

BUREAU FOR CARE OP SICK.
N«-tt Department Beingr Organized by
the Relief Corporation.
The Relief Corporation is organizing
a medical bureau. The new depart
ment will determine who of the sick,
unable to care for themselves, shall be
\u25a0treated in hospitals, and have general
supervision of relief work, so far as
medical attention is concerned. The
expense of the bureau, it Is thought,
will not be above $10,000 a month.
Under the present arrangement the
sick are being treated in seven accred
ited hospitals, which are paid $2 a day
for each patient. Last week there were
255 such cases in these hospitals at a
total cost to the corporation of $560 a
day. An investigation was made to see
if unworthy cases could not be dis
charged, but It was found that few if
any could be ordered out of the hospi
tals-without working hardship. The
relief authorities then determined 'to
have better investigation in future of
cases to be passed upon for relief.
Heretofore the cases have been in
vestigated by the Associated Charities.
In future it is proposed to employ ex
amining physicians to act in conjunc
tion with the -Associated Charities
workers. These physicians will deter
mine whether a patient should be
treated at home or sent to a hospital. •
The executive committee has asked
for a budget to cover the work for
six months. The physicians in charge
of the work have placed the expense
for that period, provided health condi
tions in the city continue normal, at
$60.000 — $10,000 a month. For the pres
ent month $14,000 was allowed for this
purpose.
The new bureau will be In charge of
Dr. J. Wilson Shields.
TRAIN KILLS HER
AS SHE PRAYS.
WILMINGTON, Del., Aug. 24.—Kneel
ing in prayer after she had struggled
vainly to free her foot from between
the ties of a Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road trestle. Miss Elizabeth Rothwell,
a young woman of this city, was
ground to pieces by a freight train yes
terday near Brandywine Springs Park.
Her aunt, Mrs. Richard Rothwell, and
a young cousin, Richard Rothwell, %vho
were with her at the time, were both
injured.
There was a farmers' fair at the
park and^ hundreds of persons saw the
tragedy. *
Miss Rothwell, her aunt and her
dausin had gone to the fair and were
crossing the trestle to take a car home,
when a whistle warned them that the
train was approaching. They turned to
run back, but when they saw that they
were more than half way across they
whe^ed about again to run ""in"" 'the
other direction. In so doin& Miss
Rothwell's right foot slipped between
the ties and became firmly wedged.
Mrs. Rothwell jumped, alighting on
the bank twenty feet below and break-
Ing several bones. The boy was too
bewildered to move and the engine
struck him, tossing him off the side of
the trestle. Then Miss Rothwell was
killed. . »

PARIS. Aug. 24. — Referring to the
question of changes in the Russian
State Bank, the correspondent of tha
Temps at St. Petersburg declares that
propositions to that effect were un
doubtedly made.
The correspondent asserts that
Rockefeller, at the beginning of the
year, offered Count Witte to advance
Russia $100,000,000 in gold in return
for a concession to build the Baltic
Black Sea canal. Russian financiers,
the correspondent says, refused to ac
cept the offer, and Count Witte then
planned a transformation of the Rus

present deposits of 600.000,000 roubles
In gold, which would be replaced by

TRAFFIC PROBLEM
NEW YORK, Aug. 24.— R. G. \u25a0 Dvn -_ &
Co.'s weekly review of trade ; tomorrow
will say:
Wall street provided the only Impor
tant development in the business; sec
tion"" during the last week, prices •of
securities rising within an: average of
$2 per share of the high record estab
lished last January, while the general
public became interested to an -extent
that lifted money rates for all periods
to a legal maximum. \u25a0•;
Owing to a few .exceptionally, large
undertakings last year in: this city, the
total value of all building -permits Is
sued in July was slightly smaller than
a year ago, but outside of NewTork
there was a .heavy increase.^ Crops are
now almost beyond danger and their
movement is becoming a difficult traffic
problem. Railway earnings 1 in August
showed an average gain: ; of 12.1 per
cent over last year's figure's, while for

Imports and %l. 446, 521 in exports as
compared with 1905. . -! -
Bradstreet's tomorrow will say: Fall
trade has still further expanded; ;buyers
are in all f leading markets }\ in -large
numbers and are operating freely, de
spite temporary checks caused. by hot
or rainy weather. The same is largely
true of industrial operations, which go
foiv.-ard with a steadily increasing. vol
ume', of output and with available"" ca
pacity in leading lines booked . far
ahead. Corn crop reports' are still'fa
vorable, a record yield of. corn, .-.a'
heavy spring ' wheat outturn and a
cotton crop next to the largest ever
gathered being in sight.
Railway tonnage is of enormous vol
ume, the. record for ""August being! the
best ever attained in that period. Gross
earnings for the first half of the month
exceeded - those of a year ago, when
trade was likewise active, by 1$ per
cent. Despite marked additions to
equipment, a car shortage-. of more or
less Importance is not unlikely later.
. Buiness failures In the United States
for the week ending 1 August 23 number
155, against 143 lasC week and 176 in

san francisco call.,['San Francisco'],1906-09-22,"Mistake at Custom House Causes Delay
of Half Hour in Siberia's Sailing.
Liner Takes Her Departure for
Orient With a Full Cargo.
The Pacinc Mail liner Siberia, Captain A. Zeeder, was halt an hour latp
In taking her departure yesterday for the Orient. The delay : waa caused by
a mistake made In the Custom-house whereby a trunkload of bonded baggage
f=om Europe was sent to the Appraiser's store Instead of to the Pacific Mail
wharf. The baggage belonged to F. Ringer of Nagasaki, who, with .his
wife and daughter, left for Japan on the Siberia after more than a year's
travel in Europe. ~ ' *;\u25a0*\u25a0- ;; - '-* ,' \u25a0\u25a0'.
The Siberia carried about 10,000 measurement tons of freight and ""her
cabins were crowded to their full capacity. W. H. Avery, general manager
here for the Toyo Ktsen Kalsha, who was to have sailed on the liner, has
postponed his departure for & few weeks..
Major J. O. Hutchlnson, in charge of a party of Cook's tourists, started
yesterday on his twentieth trip around
the world. The Siberia, in spite of an
awkward tide, made a good departure
from the wharf. Her passengers In

HUSH WORK AT GOLDFIELD
Figure* nrlafinK to Mohawk Leaaea
naaed on Estimates of Monnette
Manj' reasons are adduced around
the San Francisco Stock and Exchange
Board to explain the strong revival
of interest in the mining stock market
at this time. One of these is that
miners in the Goldfield district are
manifesting faith In their properties
by providing equipment for properties.
Elnce the strike of miners at Gold
field was ended one machinery-house
has supplied hoists to the following:
Gold Bar Mining *n<J Leasing Com piny. 25
horwpowoT electric hoist: William E&sgle, 22
boraepowrr hoist; Great Bend Diadem lease, 22
horsppower botft; Joplter Mining Company, Me-
Kenzir property. BS-horserKwe 1 "" hoist;
and Lindsay lease, S7-horsepower bolat? Jnmbo
Wonder Company. 75-borsepower hoist: Gr«at
Bend Extension Company, 22-bo»epower hoist;
Florence Extension Company, liS-Lorsepower
hoist; Great Bend Mining Company, 40-borBe
power hoist; Mohawk Consolidated Leasing Com
pany. e2-horBepower hoist; Florence Minimi Vein
Leasing Company, 25-horsepovrer hoist; Nevada
Mining Company, 25-horsepower hoist.
Besides these hoists, air compressors
and equipments for large machine drill
ing plants have been ordered and will
be installed immediately on, receipt. ""
Since the surrender of the Hayes-
Monnette lease to the Mohawk Mlping
Company new work on the property
has been undertaken by the Goldfield
Consolidated Mines, the holding com
pany. Surveyors have laid out the site
for a huge ore house and other ore
houses will be placed on the Jumbo and
Red Top. Surveys have also been made
for spur tracks to run to all the prop
erties of the Goldfleld Consolidated
Mines Company. The shaft on the Mo
hawk will be retimbered and prepared
for doing heavy work, and shaft con
nections will ba made with all the ore
producers included in the Wingfleld-
Nixon merger. The ground of the
Frances-Mohawk lease will be timbered
to hold the ground that was loosened
toward _the end of the Hayes-Monnette
lease. The Jessie shaft In the Laguna
ground will be Increased to three com
partments and the hoist and gallows
frame of the Rose Mohawk lease will
be Installed there, as the diamond drill
has revealed a large body of high grade
ore at that point. •'.•'
The Goldfleld News sums up the pro
duction of the Hayes-Monnette lease
finally. M. J. Monnette prepared the esti
mate. The value of the output during
the term of the lease, so says Monnette,
was $4,400,000. Another week, proba
bly, would have enabled the Hayes-
Monnette combine to have passed the
$5,000,000 mark for production on their
lease. Something like $1,000,000 in ore
was blocked out when the work on the
lease was ended by the ox pi rat ion of
the time limit. The g/eatest ""produc
tion of the lease in any on<r day, so
says Monnette, was $60,000, and the
highest assay was better than $100,000
to the ton. The greatest production
for any one month -was $1,300,000, In
October. The ore averaged $400 a ton
in the car. Nearly all of the produc
tion was through the No. 1 shaft
The lease was originally 373x700 feet,
but two-thirds was sold to other leas
ers who did not have such good luck
as Hayes-Monnette. The superstitious
may be Jarred by the fact that work
was begun on the Hayes-Monnette lease
on a Friday; ore was first struck on
another. Friday, and work on the lease
ended on Friday. The lease was the
most profitable of any in the history
of mining. The four owners — G. H.
Hayes, M. J. Monnette, J. W. Smith and
Harry Benedict — are each about $900,
000 richer for their lucky venture that
so successfully defied the Friday no
tion. The production did muchto bring
the Goldfleld district into prominence.
The production of the Frances-Mo
hawk leases is figured out to be more
than $2,000,000. The returns from
twelve carloads of ore amounted to
$105,348. The royalty on the Curtis
extraction made up the total output to
more than $2,000,000. The Kalfus lease
production if estimated at $90,000. The
property covered by that lease changed
bands twice. The Curtis lease, of which!
little has been said, produced, as rough- I
ly, estimated, $820,000 in gold. With j
the other leases the Truett lease haa
expired. This lease made a fine ex
traction of .ore soon after the strike
was made on the Frances-Mohawk and
a dividend of 26 per cent was declared.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', FRIDAY, JANUARY 25, 1907.
The ore diminished In value during
part of the working time, but im
proved toward the end so that the
leasing company was well rewarded for
its work. ' - *- .
Like the Hayes-Monnette combination,
the Frances-Mohawk Company will
continue to operate. The company
owns four claims lying south of the
Commonwealth, known as the Frances
group, and has also purchased the Van
Dyke lease on the Polevarde claim of
the Jumbo extension, consisting of two
blocks of ground and the equipment
from the Mabawk ground has been
removed to that place.
JURY LISTS NOT SUBMITTED

VIGILANTES WARD
OFF SCAVENGERS
Residents of West Berkeley Are
(Victors in First Day
of Fight
.Determined Stand Scares Away}
Chief of Dump Cart Men,
Who Rcconnoiters
BERKELEY, March ?. — Not a. wagon- i
l""ad of garbage was dumped in ""this]
«~ity today, for the scavengers"", warned {
by the protests of the citizens of the!
west end. made no\ attempt to haul!
l efus» matter to the old dumping ground
at the foot of Gilman street. Their de
'Msion not to unload the wagons which
hud been filled with garbage prevented
possible bloodshed on the part of the
vigilantes of the West Berkeley Pro
tective association, who gathered in
force at the corner of Third and Ca
mella streets to turn back all scaven-
Sers attempting to dump refuse along
the Wrst Berkeley shore. With gar- 1
bag* of three days' standing in the)
back yards of the residents of all j
parts of town the situation is serious. '•
Suggestions that the railroad com
pany haul the garbage out of town on
the flat cars or that it be dumped into
in* bay w#r«> made to the trustees, but
both wore said to be impracticable, the
former because of the protests of the
people living along the line of the rail
road, the latter because the tide washed
the garbage back from the ocean along
the North beach water front. !
MAXV COMPLAI.VrS .MADE i
Meanwhile numerous complaints are |
being made to the health officer, Dr.
•J. J. Benton, by house holders. Mrs.
Morris of the Hotel Carlton declared
today that the scavengers have not re-]
moved refuse for three days. * !
Thr fight being waged by the trus- j
tees and scavengers on the one hand |
and the residents on the other centers j
in West Berkeley, along tlio bay shore, !
where ineffectual attempts were made!
today to appease the. residents with the j
promise that the dumping would be
continued only a few- days"" until Fred
Foss* land at the foot of Delaware
strrot could be bulkheaded.
The vigilante? of West Berkeley de
clared that they would resist all at
tempts to dump garbage in their vicini- j
tics. Besides the knot of men gathered '
•it Thir.l and Camellia streets to force
back the scavengers a rude wire fence
was Ptretcli»d across Delaware street
above Fred Foes' property to prevent
the scavengers from gaining an en
iranoo-at that point of the tide lands.
HER 11,1, V USES DISCRETIO.Y
Joseph Berilla. head of the scaven
gers, spent the entire morning survey-,
ing tlir- property of the King Keystone
oil company at the foot of Bristol
•«treet. with .a view to dumping garbage
there. He was given full permission to
use the land as a dumping ground, but
Uerilla left, declaring that he would
<o.nfer with Mayor Francis Ferrier
about the situation.
Thf> solid mass of indignant citizens'
gathered near the water front were
within sight of Berilla as he left the
land and the determination . stamped
on the faces of the West Berkelcyans
may have influenced him to let the
trustees settle the garbage question
before the scavengers tried to force
the hand of the residents.
Mayor Fcrrier said tonight that he
had left the finding of a garbage
dumping place in the hands' of Berilla.
as the trustees for the present moment
had nothing to offer as a. substitute
for the dumping place on/ W. J.
>>chmidt's property at the foot of Gil
man street, from which the scavengers
were driven by the indignant citizens.
UECLAHES PL.AA"" UNWISE
Ferrier declared that the plan of
dumping the garbage at sea was not
a wise one on account of the action
of the tide In carrying the refuse mat
ter back, but said that"" as a substi
tute plan he would interview Superin
tendent Scott of the Southern Pacific
with a view of having the garbage
carried out of Berkeley on flat cars.
At a recent meeting of the chamber
of commerce of this city this plan
was declared unfeasible because of
opposition by residents of Suisun, who
declared that they would not receive
the garbage of the bay cities on ac
count of the danger of Infection. "" r.""
Various plans for the disposal of the
garbage will be discussed at the meet
ing of the trustees, at which' another
plan will be presented by capitalists
to relieve the situation. Their plan
will not' be publicly announced until
the board meeting tomorrow night,
but Mayor Ferrier said that the town
wharf would be utilized .by them > if
they were given the permit to dispose
of the garbage.
Protest from the citizens of the west
end will also be heard at .the meet
ing. They have-not changed their at
titude toward the board and will de
mand all dumping on the water front
be discontinued.
BOYS HEAD Y WITH STONES
The men and women of the west
«--nd lined the streets today watching
for the appearance of the scavengers.
Most of the small boys were kept home
from school by their mothers so they
< ould be on hand to stone the scav
engers should they make - their ap
pearance Each wagon -approaching
the vicinity was eagerly watched "". by
small boys located .at points of
vantage to warn the vigilantes of the
coming of the scavengers..
At the home of Mrs. W. J. Burke. at
Oorbin station near the old dumping
grounds women from the neighborhood
met this afternoon to talk over • the
situation. ""The \u25a0women denounced the
trustees and declared that they and
their husbands would ' resist-; all .at
tempts to make their homes face a gar-;
bage heap. Among the women at\ the
<ii«-r ; tin g were: Mrs. R, .. Mcrkle, ""- Mrs.
Caroline Connor, Mrs. W. J. Burke,
Mrs. J. J.H olland and, others. ,

fusal .of. the .board of supervisors -to
para printing claim for J1.653 by the
Enquirer \u25a0 publishing company. th.»
greater portion of which .was for.wprk
during the first six .months of the

cently that he would welcome. the filing
of such a suit, as the matter .of un

the ridiculously small sum of $2,000.
I Am far as can be ascertained by
eiosely examining the photograph,
tbera 'were no steamboats among the
vessels at archer. Yet there were at
that time steamers plying between
\u25a0 :.a~a and Ban Francisco. Williams
came on the first to enter the harbor 11 — \u25a0
the * California. She was a short,
stubby sidewheeler, but at that time
she was looked on as a first class boat.
She brought 500 passengers, and on
February 28, ISO, dropped anchor at

remark from way up stage, ""The car
riage has came, ma'am.""
Around the campfires of the tobacco
store Ir.dians were grouped dally and
; : "" -V.W all sorts and conditions of
cm. %'t la Interesting- to know that
cany of them had a past; It la pathetic
to remember that none of them had
& future. Some of them had seen the
world cither literally or figuratively, or
both. Several of them had been king
makers, and one of them an honorary
member of the association — old Em
jeror ICorton — was himself a king.
The passing of the open front cigar
core has signalized the passing of Its
stanch supporter, the tobacco store
Indian. In the old days practically
every tobacco store was an open front
store- Usually It was a mere hole In
the wall, but a hole that was always
v.-ide and never deep. It -was flush
\u25a0tvith the sidewalk and op*n to the
v-eather. It had no indoor atmosphere
cbout it, which accounts In some part
for th« fact that the tobacco' store* ln- ,
cian had a strangle """"hold on life.
One day a San Francisco tobacco
dealer got an idea. Instead of having:
r.n open front cigar stand, why not
have a regular store with show cases
?.nd long counters and plate glass win-;
dows? With this particular tobacco
dealer to get an Idea was to realize
it. and accordingly on Market street, ""
the backbone of the old San Francisco
and the new, the first real tobacco shop
into being-. It was a weir looking
j.aco and singularly Inviting, but th«
.;:. ""'.ar.s kept away.
Now that tobacco dealer who got an
a and realized It was not an enemy
cf the cigar stand braves. It was no
roister design on their existence that
prompted his shop's change *of front-
But the Indians to a man gave him the
Indian sign and left him severely alone..
This should have ruined his trade and:
eventually driven him out of business,
ijt It didn't. In fact he waxed ample
' girth and in the course of a few
ears' opened another store, which was
elso a closed front store.
Then a biff eastern tobacco firm laid
iMege to San Francisco and took It by
BtortnJ Many of the smaller dealers this
firm bought out, some it drove out and
fc£ralnst others still It continues to fight
Page. The Vast C of Sixty Years Have So FmnsformeciHhe Scene I hah Only :Peaksiand^lslands [;Are;Jaentical*m:!the':;r.v'^Kiclured:
the foot of Telegraph Hill. Of the 600
people who landed here on the Cali
fornia, only five are known to be alive
today. These are Henry F. Williams;
Rev. Dr. Wllle. founder of the Univer
sity of California and now 89 years
of ape; DrVT. ""C. Thompson, who lives
in Sonoma county; Gen. William H.
Platt, once surveyor general; and baac
B. Pine, a mine owner of Calaveras
county. A few years after their ar
rival a number of the passengers who
had come on the California, formed the
Steamship Ploners"" '\u25a0 society, to which
the five mentioned still belong. On the
twenty-fifth anniversary of their land
ins the Pacific Mall steamship com
pany, into whose -hands the California
had passed, placed the- boat at the dis
posal of the members of the society
All this might not have affected the to
bacco store Indian, but for the fact that
the big eastern firm did not favor the
open front cigar store. All of Its estab
rnents were and are shops with show
cases and plate*- glass windows, -and
narrow doors.
All the local cigar dealers, the men
who had seen us first, were not going
to submit without a struggle. Several
of them died in tho fight, but at least
two of them, giants In their way, have
thus far held their ground. And their
secret was that they waged war with
the enemy's own weapons. They
changed their front. The old style, open
front cigar stands disappeared; first,
one by one; then, ten by ten) until they
became the exception, rather than the
rule. This method of conducting the
great western tobacco war secured rec
ognition and eventually -success for the
local cigar dealers, but it was the undo
ing of the tobacco store Indian.
He has been -ruthlessly driven from
his favorite camping ground. Inasmuch
as he had a homo at all, the open front
cigar stand \u25a0 was his home. Now, In
very truth, he haa not whereon to lay
his head. The open front cigar stores
are- not: all gone as yet; but, sure as
fate, all of them are going. And the!
tend Is near at hand.
Some weeks ago a wealthy cattleman
.dropped into San Francisco and paused
at one of the few remaining open front
cigar stores for. something to smoke.
Three Indians were on. watch and a
dozen more in ambush and the stranger
was soon deep . in • animated conversa
tion with 4ho band. He told them who
he was and whence he came and whith
er he was bound. .Above all, he told
them"" how very, very ""rich he was.'
He had millions,- he said, in hard cash,
and countless millions on the way. Out
In the cattle country business was good.
By and'by the slot machine attracted
his attention. He had never seen one
before and wanted to observe it in
action. - One of the Indians had a nickel
and clicked it In the slot. The gods
were kind and he got three cigars. The
cattleman , was marvelously impressed.
""That looks good to me,"" he said/
I'll see what I can do.""
Ha 4ug down, into Ms chapge pookct
for atrip around the bay. It was a
notable occaslonT participated In' by
state and city 'officials'. Following"" the
excursion a banquet was held on board
and many speeches •;•. made. "".'*\u25a0 Madame
Anna .Bishop,"" then a famous, Binger,
contributed .to the. musical program,
as N did the Bohemian quartet. .The Cal
ifornia had a varied career after that.'
She was turned Into a sailing: vessel
and for a number : of years carried
lumber. At last she>,was wrecked on
the Mexican coast."" She is gone, and
so are most of the 500 who arrived on
heY 60 years ago.
Many of the buildings shown In the
photograph! were brought around the
Horn in sections and put together here:
There were several buildings of this
character still standing at the time, of
and - produced a nickel. One of the
Indians grunted. \u25a0 '\u25a0•
VLook here,"" \u25a0he remarked calmly, ""I
call that pretty small, I do. Here you
are a' multimillionaire, coming to a.
live town 'for the first time in ever
so long and .all : ; ""you can see fit to
blow In 'la a 'nickel at a time. Be a
sport.'-' . . j, ' ;,
The cattleman paused. Irresolute.
! ""What should, I -do, then?"" he asked,
humbly enough for a man who could
pay the taxes on. a Market street block
without so-much .as^wtncing.
""Do?""- the Indjan repeated.* ""Why;
play the thing with \u25a0 five dollar, gold
pieces. > The ; slot ; won't lake' twenties,
bo that's the biggest shine you can cut.""
The advice .was 'followed. The band
of, Indians . formed into a congested
crescent -and. watched the cattleman
""buck"" -the machine with glistening
gold coins. f: He dropped coin after coin
with no appreciable results. 1 ; -. He j grew
desperate, wild.- Still* the fickle goddess
did not rewa_rd him wlth.so much as a
single cigar^ When he had Invested
5145 in the machine he called a' halt.
""Maybe"" I'm no' real sport,"" he said,
ruefully,: jingling the coins remaining 1
In'his pocket, ""butjthis game's a little
too fast for me."" ' ,
Then he ordered cigars for everybody
and departed, a sadder but a wiser. man.
' . And now : the ""tobacco store. Indian |li
going, "". almost"" -'gone.-; Circumstances
have shouted in. his ear ;what no police
man ever. dared to whisp""er, ""Move on,!""
And tho waffiy bodecks himself in his

pares to hit the' trail. . ;'•;.> '""
Whither. shajl he go? \ Nobody : knows;
but, whichever path-he takes, that path
is 'sure to lead tp, the land : of ""oblivion.

Meanwhile .he paces our - streets,
strangely unfamiliar^ to 1 him in their

Pioneer Williams tells interestingly of
'San Francisco's first : postofflce*; which
was a dry goods box fitted with pigeon
holes. The ;flrst important step toward
the -establishment :of a United States
mail ' service on the Pacific coast was
taken In 1847, when by ; speclaliact of
congress a contract was* entered. Into
between the United government
and Messrs.' 'Howland. and Aspinwall
of New York to construct three small
•teamships ; for /mail service between

era was the. California, on which Wil
liams/reached this city. On It was the
first mail, .under the^ special charge
of- •.William.' Van .Voorhies, who held
ab appointment from President Polk to
establish postfflces^n California. ' His
first official act was to appoint Charles
LI Ross, a merchant,,. temporary post
master of San Francisco, and he turned
over to him the mail that- he had
brought. Under orders of Van Voor
hies, Ross converted his small private
office, adjoining ' his general merchan
dise ', store at ' the northwest corner of
Washington 'and Montgomery streets,
into a.postofflce. >. Ross employed WIN
Ham?, who had landed . only : that day,
his .twenty-first -birthday. Williams
built San Francisco's flrst postofflce In
the plainest manner possible, by con
structing some pigeonholes in a dry
goods box, which came \u25a0 around the
Horn filled with merchandise consigned
to Ross. \u25a0 The duration of this post
office ' was short, j>ne month only, for on
the Ist day of April, 1849, the second
steamer, the Oregon, arrived with an
other mail under ' charge of Colonel
John»W. v Geary, who brought with him
a commission"" from President' Polk as
the first postmaster for San ' Francisco.
Td).hlm Ross surrendered l , the* meager
effects'of his pioneer office,"" which con
sisted. of a few letters that .'had* not
been called for— part of the'-'^i'at'wall.
Colonel Geary rented an . uryjccupied
two ' etory' building at x the -northeast
corner of.; Washington r and; Stockton
stre,ets,^.which was one of the ready
framed buildings' brought from Boston
a few ' years before. ""This • waa the
second • location of ' the San. Francisco
postofflce, .but^lt '.was .never fitted up as'
such.'/'^says^.Mr. .Williams. # .""When \u25a0 I
went .mere .to inquire .-""anxiously for
'tetters, ,1-. found | Colonel Geary and his
pood wife on their iknees, assorting the
.'Setters alphabetically, : In piles, : on ""the

friends and relatives.""
Then before the arrival of the third
steamer, the Panama. June 3, 1549, a
building to be used as a postoffice was
erected at the corner of Clay and Pike
streets. Strange to say, that building

Williams Came Early
Henry tT. Williams deserves more
than any other man the dignity of the
name ""pioneer."" For more than 60
years he has resided permanently here,
leaving the city -but a short time in
1554 for a trip to the mines. He says:
""Prior to leaving my home in ""Wash
ington, r>. C. lmNovember. £84S, before
I had heard of the discovery of gold,
I had conceived that California was
destined to become a. great country be
cause or Its position on the Pacific coast
and its admirable soil and climate, as
represented 'by General Fremont and
others whose writings I had read, and
I said to myself, 'I will go there early
and grownup with, the country, profit
ing by my skill as a mechanic and
builder.* ""
Williams came .by the isthmus of
Panama, sailing from New York on
December 1, 1848, on the steamship
Falcon. Ha carried with him a'com
plete set of tools. The only people
bound with him for this state were
four government officers, four mission
ary. 1 clergymen and three young me
chanics. When the boat reached New
Orleans hundreds of . people* were wait
ing for it. fcr the news of the dis
covery of gold in this state had been
received.* ' So with 500 people on board
the Falcon -left New Orleans. At Pan
ama a . wait of more than a month was
encountered before the California ar
rived. When San' Francisco was
reached, all the, passengers with a few
exceptions, Williams among them.
rushed off to the mines. Williams,
landing on his twenty-first birthday,
built our first primitive postofflce, and
from that time on met with success
In his calling.
At that time the journey from New
York to San Francisco took nearly
three months even by the Isthmus of
Panama, on account of poor steamer
connections. Ban Francisco 'was com
pletely Isolated from the rest of the
world, but when mall began to arrive
once a month, the pioneers felt that
they were approaching moderately
close to civilization. Tet. Mr. ""Williams
says It was not until many years
afterward that people began 'to regard
San Francisco as their home. The
commonly heard expression was, ""Wai:
until I make my pile and I will go
home."" Then, as the city built up. the
Idea of remaining permanently began
to spread. That ""home Is where the
heart is"" was aptly Illustrated. The
city had begun to touch the affections
of Its residents, and Instead of going
east, they remained to build up a great
commonwealth. In the '49 days a
railroad across the continent was un
dreamed of. When finally one was
projected, people laughed at the Idea.
as some people do today at the coining
untillty of aeroplanes. ""Even if a
railroad were built."" they said, ""who
could stand the Journey?"" At that
time, with the cars In use. a twenty
four hours' railway journey was about
all that any one could endure.
Wonderf ul things have taken place
in the sixty years since Pioneer Wil
liams stepped ashore with his chest of
tools. * The city has been built up.
wiped out and built up again. And
it is because there flows in the veins
of the people of California the blood
of those sturdy pioneers, who dared
everything to ""come to the land of
promise, that Sari Francisco shows so
few scars from her disaster of three
years ago. Descendants of men who
suffered and struggled as the pidneers
did can not be discouraged by the
mere destruction of a city. Fire can
not wipe out the dauntless spirit. And
so the city proudly stands today, a
monument to the pioneers and their
descendants — her foundations the ships
that, buffeted la all the seven seas.

HONOLULU. Feb. 15. — Prohibition for
Hawaii is to be decided by a plebicite,

zations composed exclusively of
women, met yesterday and ""with one
• xception decided to petition congress
fo: permission' to vote at the special
election.
Opinions differ as to the result of
the election. There are many who say
that prohibition will win, \u25a0whether the
\u25a0women wjJl vote or not. And there are
as many who do not believe the meas
ure would pass in any event.
Many voted against prohibition at
the meetings of the commercial bodies
so!«?]>- because they did not want fed
eral interference with what they con
sidered their rights. These people will
vote for prohibition.
The abuse of liquor by the Hawaiian?
and Portuguese is alarming the em

Crowd Gathered to See Him
LOS AXGELE?. Feb. 23. — 'What's all
th^ excitement about?""* asked a police
man today, as he hurried toward Third
find Spring streets, where a. large
crowd had assembled.
""It's a run on the Merchants* na

Soon the -cry was taken up gen
erally and the crowd in front of the
hank became so dense that a riot call
for the police was turned in. Several
depositors fought their way up to the
paying teller's windows and withdrew
: r-.e:r fund?, while the astounOd bank
""ff.rials wondered what it was all
about.
When the police had dispersed the
crowd in front of the bank the cause
of the excitement was learned. James
j. Jeffries, the pugilist, had gone into
th<» institution to cash a check and the
prompt assembling of several hundred
curious persor.fr to get a glimpse of the
former champion had given rise to the
rumor that there was a run on the

THE WOMEN'S PLAN
Chaffec E. Hall Declares That
Gentler Sex Have No Place
on Executive Committee ?
BERKELEY, Feb. 23. — Chaffee E.
Hall, editor of the V Daily Californiari,
the student daily of the , university,
has stirred up a controvert}' on the
campuß^jy boldly announcing ( in ""the
editorial columns of the .college paper
today that the proposed readjustment
of the student body of A. S. U. C as it
is known on the campus, advocated by
the women yesterday was illogical and
interesting only because of its novelty.
He said that women know so little
-about athletics- that their presence on
the executive committee, the govern
ing body of tha students, would be
Valueless. # *
Miss Marguerite- ""Ogden, editor, of
both the Daily Californian Vnd Occi
dent for woman's day on the campus
yesterday argued that two- women
should be elected to the executive com
mittee. ' i
Hall, who is the son of Judge S. P.
Hall of -the appellate court.~""~belleves
that the present system of government
of the stuAuit body while not ideal; Is
the best that could be arranged under
present conditions. He said today:
Cnder the head of ""Readjustment,"" the
Woman's Day Occident presents, and the
w:otuan's I>ay Californian indorses, a tnort
novM «-hem« for the reorganization of the
A. S. l\ C. so that the executive commit
tee will include amonp its mc-mb*rs two i
womeu students. Coming, as it does,"" from .
«rlcar sky. we liar^Jy know whether the
position is intended as> the first , fhot in
tmpaipn bavin? for its objective a radical ..
npe in ""our constitution, or whether it is
fly an exposition of a plan interesting
'because' of its novelty. We hopelhe latter
•^•""itis only significance.
» Oor present system of stndent govern
* tnent, while j^crhaps not ideal, is the best
that could be devised for a co-edncatlonal
institution. It reccpnites the that
while in a general way the interest* iTE
the m<*n and women are the same, yet the
activities of the two preat divisions of the
student tody are bo widely different tljat
ibey must be directed by distinct organita
tkras.
* The women receive tbe benefits of the
A. S. I. C. and bear none of Its burden* ether '
than the regular assessm^it. And for' ibis
they not only get the same privileges as
the men, but obtain membership in \he
A. W. S. as well. A fifth of every ae«-*s
ment paid by women students is given over
to tbe financial support of their own or
ganization.
We believe that the present system is
far more locical than th» one proposed. •
The principal functioax of the executive
committee is the direction of athletic*;
j-onceniinK which nine women out of ten
are so profusely ignorant that the-judg
ment of their members on ttfe committee
in re-gard to it would be worse than §alue
' Jess.
The men know Just as little a!>out the
affairs in which the women are- interested,
and surely none of them would be so pre
sumptuous us to demand a voles in tbe
rejrulatlon of the wvinan's Jinks, regatta or
basketball games.
This difference in interest*, and ibe con
se<in«»nt incompetency of iceu or women to
dirett the affairs of the other make the
proposed change highly undesirable. We
are sure that it will never find favor with
the men. and we doubt, whether it would
even receive the indorsement of tbe ma
jority of the women.
We do not impute the loyalty of the
women, nor do we dispute tbe fact that
• they are ti.e intellectual equals of the men,
but we do hold that from the nature of
things the presence of women nn the -
executive committee would be an anomaly
aud a backward rather, than a forward step.

CAUSE OF ECZEMA EXPLAINED
After years of debate medical au-
thorities are now agreed that Eczema
and other skin diseases are not seated
in (he blood, but are caused/ by
myriads of niicroscopi<^himals gnaw-
ing the flesh just below The epidermis. \u25a0
The patient is perfectly healthy, it is;
only the skin that is.diseased.
• Hence, scientists are now agreed
that you must cure the skin through
the skip. \u25a0 The medicine must be in
liquid form in order to, penetrate
properly. And; we can say, with con-
fidence that \ve' have the true remedy
for ""Eczema in our store. -
The instant you wash with this
soothing liquid 'you will find the itch
relieved. 'We positively assure you of
this. - Will you try a bottle (at only
25c)' on our ' recommendation? Ask
for D. D. D. Prescription. ""' *

GRAND JURY WILL
QUESTION EXPERT
County Auditor Pierces Office
Will Again Be Placed Un
der Investigation
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.^-Further inTea
tigation will be made tomorrow by the
grand jury into the affairs of the of
fice"" of County Auditor George S
Pierce, which, according to the state
ment of Lester Herrick, expert account
ant of San Francisco, have been con
ducted- In an incompetent or negligent
manner.
Herrick himself will be the princi
pal witness before the grand jury. He
was commissioned by the board of SB
pervlsors last Monday morning to In
vestigate Pierces office, but as yet he
has not begun to do so. He said that
his conclusion as to the conduct of the
auditor's office was based on reports of
the auditor. The grand Jury will out
line tomorrow what it expects him to
do, as well as take from him testi
mony as to what he has alrea^F
learned. It Is considered probable that
th""c investigation into Pierces ottic*
will not be concluded by the present
grand jury, which goes out of office
In a few weeks, but may be carried
on by the next Inquisitorial body.
Pierce maintains his contention that
his books and accounts will show no
negligence or incompetence. His chief
deputy, Harry J. Rogers, was excused
from attendance tomorrow by the
grand Jury. >';; \ "":\-

DR. MOORE CASE
WITNESS GETS
WARNING NOTE
Former Night Nurse at Marine
Hospital Advised to Leave
City Before Wednesday
Seamen's Organizations Resent
Inactivity of Federal Dis
trict Attorney
Keen resentment was expressed by
officials of the seamen's organizations
last nighfwhen it became known that
threats directed against witnesses to
the alleged brutality of Dr. D. Moore
toward Mateo Brezzlnio at the United
States marine hospital had received
only passing attention at the hands of
the federal district attorney's office yes
terday. Because of their pending de
mand for a full investigation of condi
tions at the institution the union offi
cers had hoped that the intimidating
messages would be investigated.
Renewed interest in the demand of
the maritime organizations for an In
quiry bearing on the conduct of the
hospital was also aroused yesterday by
the fact that Dr. James M. Gassaway,
surgeon in charge of the institution,
who has also been under fire, was clos
eted for more than an hour with As
sistant United States District Attorney
Alfred P. Black, who is in charge of the
prosecution of Dr. Dunlop Moore.
DELL'S LIFE THREATENED
As a climax to a series of warnings
and threats made against him since he
corroborated the affidavit of Seaman
William Hoist regarding the alleged
brutal treatment accorded Brezzlnio by
Doctor Moore. Harry C. Dell, formerly
night nurse at the hospital, received
the following note on Saturday night
""Dell; if you value your life, leave
this city before Wednesday. I mean
business.""
The note was found by Dell, accord
ing to his statement, when he entered
his room after having been out for the
evening. It was printed with lead pen
cil, on note paper bearing the water
mark used exclusively in government
stationery. The handwriting also bore
a striking resemblance to that In an
anonymous communication viciously at
tacking Dell's character, which was
sent to The Call immediately after the
publication of the alleged facts con
nected with the demand for an investi
gation of conditions at the hospital.
When the matter •was brought to the
attention of Assistant District Attorney
Black yesterday, he manifested a deep
interest, but later said that he would
lot take up the investigation of the
matter at present.
SAYSTHKEATS ARE OUTRAGE
Commenting on the action of the offi
cial last night, Andrew Furuseth. presi
dent • of the international seamen's
union, said:
I have never seen Harry C. Dell
and none of the officers of the
sailors' organizations have any*
personal knowledge of what he has
stated regarding matters at the.
marine hospital. But, regardless
- of what facts this man will testify
to, I unhestitatingly denounce these
threats against him as an infamous
outrage which should be investi
gated at the earliest possible mo
menu I do not want to be un
derstood as criticising the federal
district attorney's office at this
time or as commenting on the
merits of the case against Doctor
Moore, but as is the right of every
citizen I would indorse any vig
orous legal action to bring to light
the source of these threats.- ...\u25a0-.- -
Another thing I want to make'
plain right now, and that is, that
regardless of any and all threats
the members of the sailors' unions
who have been subpenaed in this
case will be on hand at the hear
ing. The facts in connection with
the- death of Brezzinio will be
brought to light, and will be used
in support of the demand of the '
seamen's organizations of the Pa
cific coast for a thorough investi
gation of the conduct of the marine
hospital under Doctor Gassaway's
regime. If brutality, neglect and
an easy way of earning a big sal
ary are to be extolled as the func
tions of the United States marine
' hospital, it Is -time that the insti
- tutlon founded in the cause of hu
manity should be wiped out of ex
istence as a disgrace.
A fair and just inquiry is all that
is asked by the seamen at the
hands of tbe government, and this
will be secured if organized labor
has to carry the request to the
highest authority in the United
States. Statesmen of national re
pute stand ready to take up this
matter on the floor of congress if
necessary, and this course will be
i pursued, unless a real investigation
and not a ""whitewashing"" expe
. dition is the result of requests !
in other' quarters.
WITNESSES ARE SUBPEXAED
Subsequent . to his conference with
Black yesterday afternoon Doctor Gas
saway made' the statement that he had
called upon the federal official to dis
cuss a case In no way connected with
the prosecution of Doctor Moore.
Black would not say that Doctor
Gassaway's visit was connected with 'a
matter distinct from the hospital case.
Subpenas were issued yesterday for
a large number of witness to give tes
timony at the preliminary examination
of Doctor Moore, which will be held be

""The Old Virginia Gentleman
and Other Sketches""
The public at large may not appre
noVK- ?mSS **** in bringing to its
notice this charmlhg volume of
sketches. But a certain number al
ways on the lookout for the best in
American letter*, who are never led
astray by ""best -sellers.- but who*e
opinion!- are of real value— these will
all fee! that they owe Mr. Page a debt
01 platitude.
n.h Tlie oi OW . VIr * lnI * Gentleman and
Othftr Sketches"" is the title of the
hook written by George W. Bagby.
Thomas Nelson Page, in his introduc
tion to the book, says: ""Next to Poe
t.*e most original of Virginia writers
v.-as he whose reputation in his life
• time mainly rented on humorous
\u25a0kHchea of a mildly satirical and ex
ceedingly original type, but who was
master of a pathos rarely, excelled by
any author and rarely equaled by any
American author. Like Poe, his work
""•us known among his contemporaries
merely by a email coterie of friends.
But these adored hlni.
""George W. Bagby was absolutely
realistic — so purely realistic that no
one can read, even at random, a page
of his genre sketches and not recog
nize at once the truth of the picture
end — If he be a Virginian — point to the
original. He was not a ficlionlst, but
a realist. • • •
""Other writers had magnified her
(Mrgrlnia) through an idealism col
ored by reading of other life and other
time*. The scenes were painted and
so were the life and speech. It was
generally well done, often admirably
done, but it was not real. In the desert
+~ of unreality came a new writer, a con
tributor to newspapers and magazines,
who, discarding the stilts and the
struts and the •\u2666\u2666•lted palaces, pic
tured the old Vir/. nia homesteads set
back, simple 'and peaceful and pram,
under the immemorial oaks and locusts,
with the life lived there with its
sweetness and simplicity and tender
charm. • • •
""But while he pictured Virginia, he
reflected the human nature of the uni
verse. He ig set down in a recent bio
graphical encyclopedia merely as a t
\u25a0physician and humorist."" He .was much'
more than this. He was a physician by
profession, a humorist by the way, but
God made him a man of letters.""
This author has gone practically un
recognized all these years, but the war
and the dreadful and depressing recon
struction period had much to do with
that. The sketches, 16 in number, have
more than a local value, for they pre
serve with a photographic fidelity some
little known features of Virginia life
as it was before the war. One which
is a fine example of the author's home,
""When Rubenstein Played,"" has often
been printed in papers and magazines
and generally credited to Mark Twain.
Many readers will think, -without pre
judice, that it is better than anything
of the kind done by Mark Twain.
The life of Doctor Bagby is briefly
sketched. He was born in Richmond
county. Virginia, in IS2S: educated at
Princeton and the University of Penn
pylvanla, taking his M. D. at the latter.
He practiced for a time at Lynchburg,
but soon devoted himself to writing.
He edited' the Express and other papers
of his state, and his short stories and
essays appeared in all the principal
papers of Virginia. He volunteered
when the war broke out and served in
a clinical capacity at Beauregard's
headquarters. He was assistant'secre
tary of state and custodian of the state
library after the war. He died in 18S3.
""The Lure of the Antique""
By Walter A. Dyer. (Published hy tb*> Cen
tury company. New York. Price $2.40.)
The purpose of Walter A. Dyer's book.
""The Lure of the Antique."" is explained
in a long subtitle; ""A book of ready
reference for •'oll<?eto_rs of old furni
ture, china, mirrors, ""candlesticks, sil
verware, posters, glassware. copper
utensils, clocks and other household
furnishings of our American forefath
ers, and a handy guide for the deter
mination of age. style, maker, genuine
ness and value • • •' "" The book is
a sort of primer for amateurs, but will
be found of use as well as of interest
to the veteran collector. The author
never allows sentiment to run away
from him and does not agree with the
collectors who say that antiques exist
for their own sake to be treasured and
admired. He believes they have a dis
tinct use: ""I believe that antique furni
ture can be made to serve a distinct
purpose in the modern home, particu
larly the spacious country home. He
tells us the prices of the various arti
cles, a branch ofs the subject seldom
touched upon in books, which is a
great help to the beginner.
The chapter headings will give a fair
idea of the subjects and manner of
treatment: ""The Quest for the Old and
Beautiful."" ""Old Chairs in Modern
Houses."" ""Old Desks and Secretaries.""
""Tables and Sideboards."" ""Four Poster
Bedsteads and Others."" ""Some Old
Clocks."" ""The Looking Glass of a Hun
dred Years Ago."" ""Old Lamps and Can
dlesticks."" ""Old Blue Staffordshire.""
""The Beautiful Pottery of Wedgewood,""
""Luster Ware.."" ""Lowestoft — The
Porcelains — Salt Glaze."" ""English and
American Glassware."" ""Bohemian
Glassware."" ""The Collecting of Old
Silverware^"" ""The Pewter on the Dres
ser."" ""Sheffield Plate."" ""Old Brass and
Copper Utensils."" ""Where Ancient
Back Logs Glowed,"" and ""The Truth
About Antique Furniture.""
The wide range of subjects means
that each one is briefly treated, but
enough *=pace is given to each one to
prove that the author understands his
subject and knoWs JUst how much is
necessary and useful to the beginner.
Perhaps 'the most valuable chapter
in the book is the last, in which the
author gives many .suggestions for
determining whether of not the object
under consideration is ""fake."" He cau
tions all to beware of auction*, for the
excitement causes hysteria and besides
careful inspection is difficult The book
is filled with illustrations from photo
graphs, which add as much to the value
as to the Interest of the book. It is a
companion volume to ""The Quest of
the Colbnial"" by The Shackletons, Which
appeared last year.
The remarkable John Bigelow has
written two articles which form this
little book published under the title
••The Folly of Building Temples of
Peace With UntempereJ Mortar."" -The
real democratic doctrine is impres
sively preached by Mr. Blgfclbw in those
article, which were brought forth by
invitation to him to join various organ
izations for the purpose of ""promoting
peace among the nations of the earth
and for the reconciliation of Interna
tional differences, a substitute for war.""
These two articles form his excuses
for declining those Invitations. The
author declares that peace efforts are
useless until the war causes are re
moved, viz.: the tariffs on imports. He
rfves raanv reasons for his beliefs and
expresses ""himself clearly and sanely;
incidentally giving a few hard raps to
Mr Roosevelt and the Rev.i Dr. Lyman
\bbott The second article suggests a
*«übEtliute for tariff to raise revenues.
J^uggests that the state be entitled
Cta share in the profits of all f ran
ches. It is impossible in preview to
go into the subject thoroughly, but the
book is well written, and much benefit
will be derived from a careful reading
of the author's views. <B. >. Huebch

""Music of the Wild""
By Mr*. Gene Str*ttoa-Porter, author of
""Birds of the Bible."" ""What I Hire Done
With Bird*."" etc. Published by Jennings &
Graham, Cincinnati. Price $2.60.
The fortunate readers t>f the books
by Mrs. Gene Stratton-Porter need only
the announcement of a new one from
her pen to send them hurrying to the
nearest bookstore. But to those who
do not know her work a word is neces
sary. In the first place, ehe devotes
herself almost exclusively to nature
study, and birds, if one may judge from
her books, are her favorites among the
handiwork of nature. A long time ago
there appeared ""What I Have Dorio
With Birds."" telling how she had made
friends with many of the .feathered
tribe. ""The Song of the Cardinal"" is
another. Last spring that tremendous
work, ""Birds of the Bible,"" appeared,
than which nothing finer has been dbrio
""Music of the Wild"" is just what its
title tells us. It is divided into three
parts, the first ""The Chorus of the
Forest,"" the second ""Songs of the
Fields,"" and third ""The Music of the
Marsh."" Of course, the birds are the
""prima donnas.' 1 if one may so call
them, in this great nature^ chorus; but
no creature is too low or mean to have
his place in the general chorus \u25a0or
orchestra. Mrs. Porter is one of the
few elect who can understand the
"" Burning Daylight""
By Jack London. (Published liy the Macmillaa
company. New York. Price $1.50.)
The average novel reader does not
care for sociology, consequently Jack
London's last few books have not been
as popular as his earlier ones. His
latest book may not be quite so strong
a piece of writing as his ""Call of the
Wild,"" but it is more Interesting and
has a more direct and human appeal.
Elmer Harnish is the hero of the
book and we tirst meet him in a dance
hall of Circle City In the Yukon coun
try of Alaska, a few years before the
gold rush. From a habit he has had
of routing out Uis companions at dawn
with the cry that daylight was burn
ing, he had gotten the nickname ""Burn
ing Daylight"" »nd as Daylight he is
known through the story.
He is the kind of barbarian Jack
London does so well; he is perfect
physically and can do everything just
a little better than his comrades. He
is the most skillful in wrestling, in
lifting; has the greatest power of en
durance of any white man in the north
and is absolutely ""square."" His word
is his bond, but that is usual in the
primitive places; sneaks and scoun
drels can find no place there. He has
never loved any woman, being fearful
of ""apron strings"" and the habit women
have of tying men with them.
Daylight comes in to celebrate his
birthday when the book opens. 'He
has $20,000 in dust and a claim worth
as much more. Dancing and drinking
and gambling are the pleasures the
saloon has to offer and Daylight goes
the limit with them all. The poker
srame is a wonderful bit of descrip
tion and is sure to be quoted far and
wide. It is an unusually fine piece of
writing. Daylight is cleaned out and
begins over again. He has a. ""hunch""
about new gold fields and he stakes
claims all over the country. He has
little to prove his theory, but he gam
bles his prospects on the result'; he
stakes town sites and shows himself
a thorough, businessman. His ""hunch""
works. It is the great Klondike gold
rush ahd in a few years v Daylight has
accumulated $11,000,000.
This he considers a faif stake and he
goes ""out;"" He has been in Alaska
about half his life, having gone in
as a boy and the World 16 new to him*
He is just past 30, young enough td
learn and he can pmottth his fbUgh
epeech and learn to Wear civilized
clothes with little trouble. He has a
fine sense of honor and does not know
how to cope with the ""ground sharks""

A book with all the novelty and
fascination of a puzzle, all the delight
and attraction of a game, and all the
profit and pleasure of an, education in
art, geography, natural science and
biography, is difficult to imagine; but
such a rare thing has been prepared
by-EdwinL. and Emma T. Shuman. It
is entitled ""The Rainy Day Scrap

companied b>v a paste pot and a pair
of scissors. An envelope in the cover
contains 107 halftone pictures, and each
one. is to be cut out and pasted In
its proper place in the» book,, Trhich
place is suggested by a few Hues of
outline drawing and a few words of
description. It is ingenious and inter
esting and most instructive, for there
are reproductions of famous places and
pictures all over the world. (The

First,/ the prevention' and fighting of
forest ; fires; second, the . regulation of
the ""grazing of cattle and sheep; third,
the /preservation and disposition of
lumber; fourth, the wild : ardor of the

Brief Reviews
""Army Goose Melodies."" by an army
woman is the modest little title on the
cover of a Christmas booklet. Inside
on the title page we discover that they
are written by Florence KHlosrsr Kreba
and Illustrated by Herbert Morton
Stoops. They are not for children, but
are decidedly amusing and with the
clever little drawings make something
quite out of the ordinary.
""Ding. dong. dell,
The sergeant's in the well!
How did it happen so?
Dara'f I know.""
That is the sort of foolishness run
ning through the book. An interesting:
light is shedonmanyphases ofarmylife.
The drawings by Stoops are specially
clever. They add greatly to the little
volume and they lead one to expect
much from this young artist, (Paul
Elder & Co.. San Francisco.)

Both thoughtfulness and unusual
power of conpact expression mark the
contrasted modern maxims in ""Love and
Friendship,"" by Lillyan Shaffner. Tha
booklet starts with an original frontis
piece, an attractive type display of ""A
New Commandment."" being the follow
ing gentle admonition: ""With friendly
eyes, salute God's world each day; with
friendly hands, help lift the ones who
fall: with friendly thoughts, speak
words of truth: with friendly hearts, be
lieve there's good in all; with honest
soul seek friendship with they God.""
Often when one wishes to send a kindly,
remembrance to a friend a full fledged
book seems to weighty a gift for the
occasion. Then an envelope booklet
auch as this will be found exactly suit
able. (Paul Elder & Co., San Francisco;

Leading Senators, Cutten
and Birdsall
; CONSOLIDATES DISTRICTS.
AND FREEZES THEM OUT
GEORGE A. VAN SMITH
[Special Dispatch to The Call]
CAM. HE.tnQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.—The elimina
tion of two reform republican
senators for the benefit of two
democratic members of the upper house
is a feature of the Randall- bill, de
signed to carry out Meyer Lissner's in
tention to reapportion the state around
Los Angeles, that for unadulterated pall
stands second only to the very frank
declaration Of intent to rob Ban Fran- j
cisco.
The Los Angeles ..'stone purposes j
to eliminate Senators Charles P. I'uttenj
and E. B. Blrdsa'l and wipe Humboldt j
and Placer counties oft the senatorial i
map for at leas' two years In further
ance of the job to do San Francisco
-.out of the representation that It is
entitled to even under a hard and fast
mathematical scheme.
Pioneer Insurgents
the terms of Cutten and Birdsall ex
pire next year. They are among the
- pjoneers and the recognized leaders
of the anti-machine republican move
ment. They were members of the little
i bknd of insurgents who fought violently
ami without apparent success In ""the
assembly In 1&07.-""' They"" entered the
senate In 1909, after beating out the""
machine in battles that attracted the
attention of the entire state. Cutten is
chairman of the big finance committee.
i Birdsall is one of the stralghtest men
that ever sat in, a legislative body. By
those who know the Inside workings of
* this legislature he is conceded to be
one of the cleverest men in the senate.
There is none who stands closer to
Governor Johnson or who enjoys a
. larger degree of the governor's confl
»* dence. Cutten comes from Humboldt
county and Birdsall from Placer.
Just as an evidence of the power of
southern California Randall purposes to
hook Humboldt' county on to , Senator
John Bunyon Sanford's district and
Placer county onto Camlnetti's baili
wick. Sanford and Camlnettl are demo
cratic holdovers. The Inclusion of
Humboldt county in Sanford's district
would preclude Cutten from running to
succeed himself, since his district would
be represented In the next senate. The
same state of facts would arise in Bird
■all's district if Placer were thrown into
ramlnettl's district.
San Francisco Loses
That Job is on a par with the treat
ment Meyer IJssner's statesman pur
poses to accord San Francisco. By a
llmple scratch of the pen and a steam
foller vote San Francisco's representa
tion in the senate Is to be reduced from
nine to six and in the assembly from
15 to 13. The Los Angeles representa
tion Is Increased to eight senators and
16 assemblymen. Roseberry, who wants
. ' change in his district to Insure the
▼retention""? of his scalp, is left to shift
for himself, but Miguel Estudlllo's hope
for the separation' of Riverside ' and '
Orange counties and the substitution
of Imperial for Orange will be realized
if the Randall bill for the redemption
ft the Lissner promises can be pushed
through. That, however, will prove to
be a job worthy of the best efforts of
Boss Lissner.
Statesman Randall fixes SO,OOO as the
basis for the apportionment of assem
blymen and 60,000 as the senatorial ba
sis. "" If his orders were not to punish
San Francisco for the tremendous han
dicaps it has triumphantly overcome in
four years; if he were permitted to
rest content with exacting every last
ounce of flesh that could be, demanded
by Lissner on that mathematical basis,
he.would be compelled to concede San
o Francisco's absolute right to seven sen
ators and 14 assemblymen. But Jus
tice Is no part of that game."" In one
i section of the state Randall and his
bosses deem a population of 20,000 or
even less a sufficient .basis for the ap
portionment of an assemblyman, but
San Francisco Is to : be penalized for
accomplishing what no other city ever
accomplished, for ""laughing at a dis
aster that would have wiped a less
courageous community- out of the
scheme of civilization.
Future Discounted *
Los Angeles Is to be apportioned on
the basis of expectations.. Other, com
■ I munlties are to be considered as having
.Aa chance to grow. San Francisco,
whose recuperation and Increase- in
population Is the marvel of the world,

lie will stay in Washington and.fight
it out in the senate. His political fate
depends upon preventing San Fran

Suggestions for Many Changes
Made by Men Who Drew Up
Berkeley Instrument
BERKELEY, Feb. 28.—Recommenda
tions for changes in the. Berekeley
chart#r were made to the city council
today by the board of free holders

All members at the board of free
holders, except Mayor Beverly L. H'Hig
head, Commissioners C. Hoff and R. A.
Berry, signed the recommendations,
which are concentrated largely with
the Initiative, recall and referendum.
In their report the free holders ad
mitted that when the charter was
drawn up they had not time to give the
care they desired to the provisions gov
erning the recall, initiative and refer
endum.
The report suggested that the term!
of the council, sitting as a hoard of
equalization, be reduced and ■ that the
second election be held two weeks after
the first instead of three; also that an
official might be recalled after he had
served three months'lnstead of six. .
| Certain ambiguities should be cor
rected, the free holders ■ reported,* and
the school tax separated' from that de
voted to other city purposes. .They also
wished the voters to say whether- the
commissioner*: of finance and revenue
should receive a salary as a member of
the board of education.

for f?M of a Richard T. Wilder, who
gave his address as the Elks' club,
Oakland. On behalf of Mrs. Patty the
police are searching for Wilder.

ished in the swamps and marshes. They
were forced to travel ! for 20 miles In
dugouts propelled by negroes en the
Chagres river to Gogona. They took
mules for the hard road to Panama.

passengers landed at a pile of rocks at
the corner of Jackson and Sansome :
streets there were hundreds there to
greet them.

forts. For many years ,he was secre
tary of the board of trustees of the
College of California, the precursor of
the; University of California, j for which

TRYING 10 FORCE OS6QQD OUT OF
THE CUT BATE CI9AR BUSINESS
Dealers Endeavor to Shut Off Source of Supply—Druggist
Challenges Them to a Price-Cutting War—Saved
His Customers Over $10,000 Last Year
and Proposes to Stand Pat
A number of local cigar dealers, ap
parently incensed at trie loss of busi
ness occasioned by the cut rate prices
at which cigars are being sold are en
deavoring to get manufacturers to re
fuse to deliver goods to Osgood, the ■
druggist. Osgood does a big business
by selling standard cigars in staple |
siies for about 20 per cent less than I
the regular price. His object in sell
ing them is simply to popularize and
advertise his store and he doesn't pro
pose to quit without a fight.
""For a long time I've been selling
12%e Optimos, Beimonts, El Kidelos, etc.""
for 10c and all 5c brand* such as Owls,
Renowns, etc, at 7 for 25c,"" said OSi
good, ""and now these fellows are
trying to teluff me out. I pay cash for
these cigars and have a right to sell
them for any price I wish and I can't
See how they can stop me. It is true
I have cut into the business O f some
of the cigar dealers, but competition is
the life of trade and if they don't like
it let them meet my prices. I can
afford to sell cigars cheaper than ex
clusive dealers because I have no rent
to pay and am not personally de
pendent upon my cigar business for a
profit. In fact, I simply run the cigar
department in order to get men to
come to my drug stores, and the prices
I charge are of very little consequence
just so I get the men accustomed to
coming into the store.""
Mr. Qsgood stated that he was ready
for a priee-euttt*i£ war on cigars any
time anyone desired to stECrt it and
ventured to say that the public i»t»r-

A Big Difference
If Ton Are Suffering the Tortures of
Indigestion and HaTe to Walt
Until Someone Buns to the
Drue Store for a Box of
Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets •
Free Trial Package
. The jnstant relief afforded poor over
burdened* stomachs by the use of a
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet should be a
reason for constantly keeping, a box
on hand—»at home and at the office as
well.

The Stomach Welcomes Quick Relief
A Stuart's Tablet not only aids diges
tion, but it actually does the digesting
itself. In other words, it furnishes ex
actly the same elements for the diges
tion of food as the nat""ral juices of the
stomach. The stomach, therefore, is not
called upon to do any of the work ex
cept to churn the juices furnished by
the tablet and then push the digested
food along into the intestines, where It
will be still further digested and the
strength taken up by the blood to be
carried to the muscles and nerves of
the body.
So by taking a Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablet after a meal you give the stom
ach the rest it needs in which to mend
itself and grow well again. And yv;
absolutely prevent the souring of any
food, the formation of any poisonous
gases, belching, foul breath or consti
pation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets ha ■
more for hi.inanity and have
more rejoicing than any othi
agency that can be named.
Every druggist everywhere sells ami
personally recommends Stuarts !>vs
pepsia Tablets. The price is ""<<

BOOM HERE, IT IS PREDICTED,
WILL ECLIPSE 1848 GOLD RUSH
CHICAGO, Dee. 4. —California's sur
passing advantages as a good place
ama canal is about to open Ibe world’s
markets to the state’s products—-were
proclaimed all day long recently at
the land show. The day was Cali -
fornia’s at the Coliseum, and orators
and exhibitors put forth special ef
fort to impress on the thousands who
Hocked into the vast structure thai
the slate is about to enter an era of
prosperity compared with which the
boom that followed the gold rush will
fade into insignificance.
In the addresses in various halls
special emphasis was laid on the Pan
ama-California exposition in 1915. .1.
A. Jasper of San Diego was the chief
lecturer on this topic, hut all the oth
er speakers dwelt on it. Other speak
ers were D. \V. McDaniels, who talked
about the general resources of (In
state, and Miss Hose Shelton, whose
special topic was the winter resorls.
All the lectures were illustrated with
vivid moving pictures, California,
among other blessings, enjoying a rep
utation of being the best place On
earth to take moving pictures. The
climate and the atmosphere, especially
in the south, are particularly conducive
to good photography. The pictures
that proved most attractive were those
of the (’.awston ostrich farm and the
rose carnival at Pasadena.
California’s exhibit covers more
space than any at the show. That of
the southern part of the stale, the
region below the Teliachapi river, is
the most extensive. It includes t i
booths and the cost to bring il to
Chicago and set it op reached approx
imately SIO,OOO.
Charles C. Wilson is in charge. He
is a member of the Chamber of Com
merce of Los Angeles and is the gen
eral manager of the Southern Califor
nia-Panama exposition coinmissidn.
This commission is paying the hills
of the Southern California display. For
merly this work was undertaken by
the Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce. hut when the commission,
which embraces all the Southern Cali
fornia counties, was formed ti • look
after that section’s part in the 1915
show if also took over this general
publicity work.
In the variety of its products Hie
California exhibit surpasses anything
in the t.oliseum. The state grows
practically everything raised anywhere
else in the country.
The fruit, exhibit proves mosf at
tractive to the casual visitor. il
ranges through citrus fruits peculiar
to that section to deciduous fruits
grown in profusion elsewhere. There
are pears, plums, apricots, peaches,
qirnces, oranges, lemons, pomegran
ates, alligator pears, mangoes and many
others. There is a good display of
nuts, olives and olive oil. Even cot
lon is getting to he a typical Cali
fornia product. They are raising much
of good quality in the Imperial val
ley.
*»rio of the little things in the South
ern California display that attracted
the interest of the women especially
were the “eucalyptus curtains.” They
are made of the seed pods of the euca
lyptus tree.

HOME MADE OLIVE OIL
Written for the California Cultivator
by L. .1. Phelps: I beg to submit for;
the benefit of your readers a method'
of making a small amount of olive oil j
for family use. 1 have followed Hum
plan for a number of years with per- j
feel success.
When picking Hie olives for pickling
I leave all the small ones on the trees.;
Some time in the next month or two;
when 1 have leisure 1 go through the
grove again and pick as many of the
small ones as I wish for oil. I gel
one gallon id' oil from about SO pounds
of olives. I spread .the fruit out in
drying trays so that they stand not
more than one inch deep and stack
the trays in Hie shed with strips be
tween or stack crossways to allow
ventilation. They remain thus til!
some time during the winter, when
Hu- berries have become somewhat
shriveled. This part is not necessary,
hut they work better when about one
quarter dry.
Some day in January or February
when il rains too hard lo work out
side 1 make my oil. As the weather
is ususaliy cool enough to congeal the
oil it is necessary to provide some
artificial heat. 1 first put a quantity
of the berries in a tub of warm wa
ter. about. 100 degrees, then grind
them through my cider mill into a tub.
I have prepared some squares of bur
lap about twice the size of (lie crib
of my press and pack the crushed
olives in the crib in layers with the
burlap after the lime honored meth
od of building a cheese in a cider
press, except that I use no wooden
slats between the layers.
For a settling lank 1 take a 10-gal
lon olive cask, knock out Hit- bead,
here a half-inch hole in the side near
the hoHoni tor a spigot and stand a
piece nf inch gas pipe in il just
long enough lo reach above the side,
Inin ihi-s tank I put the juice as
il comes from the press. When the
cheese is as dry as I can get il I
take il from the press, strip the lay
ers of pomace from the burlap, throw
them iiitn a tub and heat them up
with warm water, not hot, and press
them the seciunt time, after which 1
throw the pomace away.
1 usually let the second cheese stand
in Ho- press until me next day. forc
ing down the screw from time to lime.
If my settling tank is not full when
I have finished all my olives, I nearly
fill il with warm water to facilitate
skimming off the oil. pouring Hie wa
ter from the spout of a teakettle
through the gas pipe so that the wil
ier enters Hie bottom without disturb
ing the oil on the surface.
The juice should he allowed to slam!
in the settling tank Iwn or three weeks,
occasionally drawing off a few quarts
of the liquid from the spigot and re
placing it with warm water through
the pipe. When a considerable depth
l of oil has appeared on the surface
I skim il 1 iff with a spoon, being care
ful not to disturb the turbid juice be
low the oil until the last skimming.
Then when 1 have got all the clear oil
I take about an inch of the juice off
and place it in a small open vessel to
ne skimmed again later.
For tillering the oil 1 use a common
tin funnel, lining il with galvanized
mosquito netting and using common
tiller paper, procurable at any drug
store.
I suppose that I get only about half
Hie oil out of the olives by Ibis meth
od. hut what 1 gel is far superior lo
anything that can he bought on the
market. it is the first new virgin
oil. The last run under heavy hy
draulic pressure is not really til for
table use. lull the manufacturers mix
it in with Hie virgin oil, thereby in
creasing the volume at Ihe expense of
the quality.

seeks to have transferred to the su
perior court of Riverside from the local
federal jurisdiction the eases of Ani
brosie Apapas and nine other Indians
charged with the murder of William B.

the transfer is llial the defendants are
American citizens, made so by a treaty
signed after the war between the

important by the government, and Dud

SEATTLE, Bee. i. -N. Yatsushiro,

dition of Japanese on the Pacific coast,
believes exclusion lias been beneficial
to his countrymen residing in America.
""The effect of exclusion has been In
improve the condition of the Japanese
in this country,” said Mr. Aatsushira.
“Before the exclusion order they came
here to slay only a short time. Now
they hope to make their homes hero.
The result is a higher standard among
them. 1 think the Japanese laborers
are responsible for whatever anti-Jap

Most of them are rough, uneducated

Imperial Water Company No. 5 offers 54,000 shares of water stock at

the price will be advanced to $12.50 per share.
The unsold stock, 54,000 shares, will not cover all the land that will
be under the East High Line canal, hence it should be quickly under
stood by entrymen that this is the time to buy.
A mutual water company like No. 5 cannot be forced to deliver
water to any land not covered by water stock in Imperial Water Com

No commissions will be paid for selling stock, no graft, no bonus to

Cement head gates will be used, meaning stability and less cost of

LICK WINS A.A.L. CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIP
MOUNTAIN VIEW
LOSES TROPHY
IN 0000 SPIRIT
Hollister of Poly Individual
Star —Swope Wins the
Lake Merritt Race
in Oakland
WILLIAM UNMACK
Mountain View made a plucky fight ,
at Berkeley yesterday to retain its hold j
on the Tibbetts cross country cham-j
pionship trophy, but the Lick lads were i
too strong and came home a winner j
with 111 points to Mountain View's 102. j
Five lads representing Napa high j
showed ability and nosed out Cogswell
for third place, the up country lads J
scoring 85 points to the city boys 83.
Paul Hollister of polytechnic was the j
Individual champion of the event and
won from Gavigan of Sacred Heart by j
S"" seconds. Then the country bred lads !
showed up in good style, two other sec- I
tlons of the state being represented in ;
Loucks of Mountain View, who took
third place, and Falconer of Napa, who
trotted into fourth. The race between
these two was the best finish of the day. I
only two-fifths of a second separating I
them.
Lick, the winning team, had to fight j
all the way with Mountain View, the j
country boys keeping close company (
throughout the race. Had the posl- j
tlons of a Lick and Mountain View |
boy been changed in the seventh and j
eighth or the ninth and tenth posl
tlons. Mountain View would have won j
the event. As it was the Mountain i
View boys took their defeat in good j
part and acted the part of real sports.
E. Loucks. who placed third in the
race, went to the Lick dressing room
witen the result of the team prize
was known and congratulated the Lick
team. He then visited Secretary Tib
betts of the Academic league, who
handled the race, and returned the
championship trophy to hint.
""I am sorry we lost Mr. Tibbetts,"" j
he said, ""but we will be back next I
year and hope to regain the cup. We
did the best we could. We had a good
team, but Lick has a better one. We j
offer our congratulations to Lick.""
HOLLISTER RUNS WELL
Hollister of Polytechnic ran a well
judged race. From the start he took
the lead and set his own pace. The
race was started at the old baseball i
ground on the University of California'
campus and before the men got out on J
Center street Hollister had a lead of l
100 yards. He kept this lead all the
way, though In the last quarter of aj
mile he piled on more speed and won j
by considerably more than that.
Gavigan of Sacred Heart, Loucks of
Mountain View and Mangelsdorf of
Lick formed the little bunch that
trailed Hollister, and this trio arrived
at the half way point—Cerrito creek —
in these positions. * Closely following |
the trio were Falconer and Wlnstead.
both of Napa, about 20 yards behind
the trio led by Gavigan. Leaving the
half way stations the positions of the
men started to change considerably
and a number of the men who had been
holding back began to pull up.
Lick and Mountain View men showed
up well in the finish. Lick men took
sixth, eighth, ninth, eleventh and twen
tieth positions, this giving them the
team prize. Mountain View finished j
third, tenth, twelfth, seventeenth and j
twenty-first.
Thirty-two athletes. representing!
seven schools, started, and every
man finished. Theie was a time limit
of 45 minutes set, all doing the dis
tance inside this limit. The distance
was less than five miles and the time
of the winner, 25 minutes 7 seconds,
was good for the course.

lIDERFUI CROP
AT THE RINGS!
Wolgast Takes Off $10,000,
While Murphy Gets $5,000
for His End
Continued from Page 73
slugging for head and body. Murphy
started most of these rallies, but Wol
gast generally held him about even
when he got warmed up. At times
both men were tired and groggy, but
they kept on fighting nevertheless.
The ninth was a hurricane affair.
Wolgast opened it up by rushing Mur
phy and landing a couple of hard wal
lops to the body. Then Murphy rushed
Wolgast to the ropes and plastered
him with all sorts of wallops. Wolgast
eased up. while Murphy continued his
a'tack and had a shade at the con
clusion of the period.
The tenth was""even, and so was the
eleventh. Murphy proved the ag
gressor, but Wolgast. who had been
resting up. was just wise enough to
keep going In order to prevent his op
ponent from gaining a decisive lead on
him.
APPEARANCES DECEIVE
Both did some rough Infighting and
clinching, and they pulled up tired
each time. It did-look as though Mur
phy were getting weak and Wolgast
were gaining In strength, but the sub
sequent rounds did not bear out this
theory.
Murphy had both the twelfth and the
thirteenth, but he was forced to take
a lot of punishment to the body. Wol
gast would rest up and then cut loose
when he saw his chance. Time after
time he rocked Murphy, but he never
kept up his good work and Murphy
generally finished* up stronger and
gained the lead.
From the fourteenth on Wolgast was
the leader, save In the eighteenth and
the twentieth. It looked as though he
had saved up enough strength to tear
in and knock his opponent out. But
he was figuring on a tougher bird thaij
he thought.
TOMMY BOBS UP SERENELY
Murphy tired at times .when his op
ponent forced him, but his recuperative
powers were marvelous. He would
squirm out of a tight hole just when
he seemed to be out of the running, and
the next round would find him fighting
faster than ever.
They kept slamming and hammering
away with all the fury left in them
in the last two periods. The spectators
were In an uproar. Some were shout
ing for Wolgast, but the majority were
Murphy shouters. Each fighter seemed
to realize that he could not register a
knockout, but he kept trying never
theless.
Wolgast finished with a badly cut
lip and a discolored eye, but otherwise
he was unmarked. Murphy sported a
bruised nose, a black eye and a cauli
llower ear when the final bell sounded.
Sunshine Takes Place
Of Threatened Storm
Promoter Jim Coffroth made good on
his weather prediction against Fore
caster McAdie and the day dawned
bright and clear for the fight. The sun
shone brighter as the hours flitted by,
and when the two fighters entered the
ring, it was positively warm. Over
coats were cast aside and gloves drawn
off.
A gala day crowd greeted the
fighters. Fully 8,000 fans of all sizes
and ages were there to cheer and root.
Murphy was the under dog and conse
quently had more boosters on his staff.
But Wolgast was not without friends.
The big bettors were stringing with
him and they lent their applause every
time he did some good for himself. It
was really an Impartial crowd when
either lad did something worth while.
Both were cheered when they showed a
flash.
The receipts netted just a few dol
lars below the $20,000 mark. Wolgast
Signed for a guarantee of $8,500 or 50
per cent of the house. This means
that he will get the tidy sum of $10.
--000. Murphy agreed to take 25 per
cent, which will give him $5,000, more
money than he ever got for a fight
during his long ring career.

success, proved too much for ""Red""
Robinson, a lightweight from Pitts
burg, who has hooked up with Packey
McFarland and some of the best 133
pounders on the Atlantic side. Aza
vedo was, given the decision by Ref
eree Harry Baker at the conclusion of
ten rounds of boxing.
Azavedo outfought and outboxed ths
*astern scrapper through jut the ten
rounds. The latter was pretty shaky
at different stages of the bout and it
looked as if Azavedo might win de
cisively by a knockout. Robinson
proved a game bird, however, and bat
tled back, but he seemed to be up
against it
The contest was fairly evert until
the fifth round, when Azavedo landed
a telling right to the Jaw that sent
Robinson down. The blow was a hard
one. but It did not keep the eastern
boy down. He managed to get up be
fore the gong. Azavedo tried hard to
finish his man, but Robinson managed
to weather the storm of blow*.
Azavedo continued to outfight Rob
inson after the fifth round, and In the
eighth round he staggered Robinson
with hard rights and lefts. He tried
hard to la/id a knockout, but Robinson
managed to evade all sleep producing
blows aimed at him.
The ninth round was decidedly In
Azavedo's favor, as he managed to
land blows on Robinson's head which
lad him groggy. However, he was
not able put over the knockout. Both
boys went to it in great style In the
tenth with honors In favor of Azavedo.
The decision met with approval.
Kid Bertelsen substituted for Tony
Freitas and boxed Eddie Miller four
rounds to a draw. It was a good scrap,
as both boys were battling hard all the
time. The crowd thought Miller had
the shade, but Referee Baker called
honors even,

STANFORD ELEVEN WINS
SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP
Cardinal Rallies Two Min
utes Before Finish and
xV'Puts Final Goal Over
BERKELEY, Feb. 22.—Stanford won
the Intercollegiate soccer series with
California this afternoon by taking the
final game by a score of 3 to 2. The
game looked to be California's until
the last of the second half, when the
Cardinal came from behind and by sen
sational playing pulled out of the fire.
Stanford's win gives it possession of
the Williamson trophy for this year.
The first gamo of the series resulted
In a victory for the Cardinal, but on the
second meeting California managed to
tie. If they had won today, the Blue
and Gold would have had an equal
claim to the trophy.
Dozier kicked off for California, and
the Blue and Gold players assumed the
offensive and rushed the ball into Stan,
ford territory. After a short time the
Cardinal rallied and for the remainder
of the period the ball was mainly in
California territory.
Dozier kicked off in the secoad.
After eight minutes of fierce play
Thorp shot a goal for the first score.
In less than three minutes California
had added another tally.
Two scores looked to be a safe lead,
but wlthrn a few minutes the Cardinal
players showed that they were in the
game to win. A foul by Thorp gave
the visitors an opportunity of a free
try at goal. The Stanford forwards
engaged In some wild shooting at goal
and Pellas managed to land one In the
net. The score came as the result of
a beautiful 30 yard kick. Stanford
was then coming with a rush, and
only the brilliant work of Barbers
averted several scores.
Benny Erb was responsible for the
next score, Pellas to Erb. This tied
the score and it looked for a while as
though the game would end 2 to 2.
Two minutes before the end a foul by
a California player gave Erb an oppor
tunity for a shot at the goal.
The teams lined up as follows:

her first defeat of the season at Juarez
today in the fourth event for sprinters
at five and a half furlongs. The faint
hearted but speedy Pride of Llsmore {
took the measure of the speedy daugh- j
ter of Abe Frank. The winner left the I
post in his stride and opened up a big |
gap on the field until the run for home, i
when Pan Zaretta began to overhaul '
the flying leader. However, the dis- '
tance proved too short for the filly and j
she was a length behind at the wire, j
Not a favorite finished in front and the j
talent had a disastrous inning. Jockey

BAREBACK POLO
TAKES CAKE FOR
A REAL NOVELTY
Latest in Thrillers Is Intro
duced at the San Mateo
Polo Club by Two
Teams
JOHN D. BROMFIELD
.Special n'«=r>*trh to The Call>
BURLI.VGAME. Feb. 22.—Bareback
polo was introduced for the first time
on the Pacific coast and possibly In
the United States today, when two
teams of local pololsts played two fast
chukkurs on Croesways field minue
the customary saddles. The new de
parture ib the sport pro v ed most ex
citing from the spectators' standpoint,
but it presents too much danger to
become popular, except as a fad.
Strange as it may seem, the two
teams taking part in the bareback
match were composed entirely of the
younger exponents of the game. Will
Tevis. who has had much experience
In riding broncos at his father's ranch
near Bakersfield, first broached the idea
th.is week, but it was received with
disfavor by most of the older players.
After using all his persuasive powers.
Tevis finally succeeded in gaining tho
consent of Paul Verdier, Douglas Alex
ander, Bert Payne and E. McAllister to
give his scheme a try. When the teams
lined up Tevis and Verdier took one
side and McAllister, Alexander and
Payne the other.
While the dangerous bareback game
was under way Hobart, Driscoll, Pev
ereux, Lawson and several otlior vet
erans stood on the side and specr.
lated upon the chances taken by the
young riders.
Fortunately nobody slipped from hla
slippery seat, and there were no acci
dents to record. That the gamo was
rather slow from the standpoint of
scoring was evidenced by the fact that
Tevis tallied the only goal during the
two chukkurs.
Following the bareback exhibition,
14 players took part in a cutin prac
tice, preparatory to the big match be
tween the Juniors and Veterans to
morrow. Those who took part in the
practice were: Hobart, Driscoll, De
Guigne, De Coulon, Alexander, Dever
eux, Elklns. Pratt, Cameron, Tevis.
Lowson, Verdier, McAllister and
Payne.
Devereux has consented to play In
tomorrow's at El Cerrito, so the
lineup has been arranged by Polo
Manager Hastings as follows:
Juniors (Coronado team) —No. 1, Elklna; No.
2, Tevis; No. 3, liavno; back, Hastincrs.
Veterans —No. 1, Verdier; No. 2, Driscoll; No.
3, Devereux; back, Garritt.

Rochester Begins Like All New Camps
EVERYTHING MUST BE ON THE SQUARE, IS RULL
MARK TWAIN AND BRET
HARTE SHOULD RETURN
TO ENJOY THE REVELS
Like Roaring Gimp, Angels and Other Frontier Camps of
Gold Rush Days, Men Are Free and Boisterous, and
There Is Very Little Order, but There Is No Lawless
ness and the Towns Are Beginning to Be Staid and
Settled Down, and the Prospects of Prosperity Are
Encouraging.
Tf the* spirits of Mark Twain and Bret

their frequent abiding place must be

Jumping , Frog , of Calaveras,"" and the
bard who sang of Angels Camp, would
revel in word pictures of frontier days

*'legible pen Instead of the one with
which they are, no doubt, writing the

For Rochester is* Roaring Camp, Gal
lup, TVinslow, Sonora and Tuolumne all
•omblned In a wholesale resurrection of
(he days when the gold ferver was pass
ing through its early symptoms in the
west. Undoubtedly the most Interest
ing part of the camp Is the night life.
There is a fascination in Its weirdness,
its , unconventional ways, Its wanton
ness and its freedom. Throughout the
day prospectors scour the hills, mm•
-• - drill through rock that resembles
In its hardness, and men in their
nrious occupations undergo hardships,
■\posure and fatigue. When night
onie.""= they seek relaxation.
NO ARISTOCRACY
There are no theaters** no reading:
rooms, no churches, but there are sa
oons, dance halls and gambling places.
if is all open aorid above board. There is
i> Mdinj? of these pastimes. The
't-isrht lights flickering In front of
tents i j .nd cabins , beckon the tired miner
and the prospector. ""Within the re
ports there is warmth and companion
ship and men in mining camps, without
estraint. without amusement, seek

ature and that is what makes the

cook, the prospector associates with
the gambler. There is no segregation.
All are thrown together and this very
melting pot makes a scene which is
strangely alluring.
Rochester is not unlike every other
mining camp which has ever sprung
up in Nevada in almost a night. It has
its rough, unrefined, unpolished aspect.
An auto truck loaded with three tons
of freight pulled Into Rochester. On
the top of the load were 15 passengers.
There were saloon men, gamblers,
roustabouts, prospectors, miners and
clerks. It was a crowd that in any
other community would have occa
sioned astonishment, but In Rochester
it was taken as a matter of course.
Such is the freedom of a mining com
munity.
\O TIME FOR SLEEP
All night the saloons are open, gam
bling in full swing, and around the
stoves which throw out their genial
warmth in the drink emporiums col
lects a motley crowd of camp follow
ers ever ready to respond to an invi
tation Jto ""have a drink.""
On tables, benches, chairs', hanging ,
limply over barrels, boxes and any
other handy object are men fact asleep.
They seek the saloons for the warmth
of the stoves and nap. They stretch
on the floor when the chairs and
benches are occupied. It Is a sight
common in mining campe. In one sa
loon around the table are eight men
playing ""Big Indian."" the gambling
game which is now the most popular.
Before them is , stacked gold and silver
and under the pile, greenbacks. The
play is brisk. In ""Big Indian"" money
moves rapidly. Tt is not a poor man's
game and neither is Rochester a poor
man's camp. Tt costs money to play
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 9. 1913 r
$1,450 Ore in Lincoln Hill
The latest development in the Rochester district has fairly startled
the mining world. Last Thursday news was telegraphed to San Fran
cisco that 38 inches of ore taken from the Abe Lincoln claim, on Lin
coln peak, has run $1,450 to the ton.
This news is taken to prove that the ore does not run all to one
place—Nenzel mountain. There has been some uncertainty as to the
prospects on the neighboring hill, Lincoln mountain, but this uncer
tainty is dissolved by the assay of the 38 inch ore shipped Thursday.
There is now no doubt that Lincoln peak will prove as great a bonanza
as Nenzel mountain.
The effect of this announcement has been a rush of prospectors
from the environs of Nenzel mountain to the lower stretches of the
other hill. Work on claims which had not been touched already has
startled, and the activities on the claims near the summit Jjave been
doubled. Tunnels are being pushed in, and shafts sunk, with a vigor
that has not marked a mining camp since Goldfield days. With Lincoln
peak showing up as well as Nenzel mountain, the glory that has been
Tonopah's is sure to crown the new camp, leaving Tonopah second
place in the list of permanent strikes.
""Big , Indian"" Just as It cost money to
drive tunnels through solid rock to
reach a vein of ore eight feet distant.
OH, THAT PIAXO!
In one saloon which assumes the
dignity of a dancing- hall because it
possesses a piano, the piano player is
too far gone from the effects of the
night's business to even see the keys.
He hangs helpless over a barrel, and
no amount of coaxing can Induce him
to stagger over to the piano and grind
out a tune. But the piano does not
lack for players. Other fingers can
""tickle the keys."" and they do. It is
near daylight, but one hour is as good
as another in a mining camp where ex
citement runs , high.
There are saloons doing business in
the lower town whose bar tenders can
hardly distinguish between the bottle
and the cork. The early part of the
evening is too strenuous. In one sa
loon it is necessary to drag the bar
tender away from his' berth by the
stove. He swears under his breath
when each member of the party calls
for a different kind of drink. It takes
a half hour to serve it. but there are
no sleeping accommodations to be had
at that hour and time must be killed
until daylight. The saloon is too hos
pitable to be ignored.
Some day the town will settle down
to be a staid, business like community.
Goldfleld has , ; Leadville did, and Roar
ing Camp is now a village of such
claims to respectability as a half a
dozen churches, a town jail and a.
""squire."" But, somehow, these towns
have lost their \romance, and that will
be the case with Rochester. As the
prospectors become men with hoards
of money In the bank, and the leasers
who now care for nothing but their
proximity to ""the vein."" turn their at
tention to the town bite and sell lots,
while their hired men are digging on
the hill, law and order will enter in
and less noise will echo from out the
saloon doors. Then another mining
camp will have passed into history, to
have in its stead a shafted, smoke
stacked ""city,"" with a depot and a
hotel with an elevator in it. and only
the sound of chugging machinery to
remind the pioneers of the clicking
of the picks of the earlier days.
BIG GREEN CAR GIVES
GOOD EXPRESS SERVICE
Motor Stage From Lovelock
Driven 5,000 Miles With
out a Single Mishap
Express service from Lovelock to
Rochester has been established. It is
an especial kind of express service,
the modern idea of what a stage line
should be. There is no pair of teame,
no driver with gun poised across his
knee on the watch for highwaymen—
just a speedy, big green car of the
Chalmers type, with the proprietor
driver at the wheel. This P. D. is a
keen eyed, steady nerved young chap,
who has the record of having , driven
5,000 miles back and forth between
Rochester and Lovelock, with all kinds
of freight, human and mineral, with
never an accident to mar the trip along
the treacherous mountain and desert
roads.
When Rochester shall have become a
staid business community there will
be many legends of these days told to
regale the successors of the present
pioneers, and among- these miners' tales
will be stories of Oroville Marker, the
aforementioned P. D., which will be
quite Important items in modern auto
mobile lore. For there is hardly one
of the men who are making fortunes
hand over ftet in the Rochester district
who has not made the Irlp from Love
lock to Rochester in the ""big green
car , ' of Marker's, swapping prospects
along the way, or in conversational
gambling upon the future of the new
mining camp.
NO WILDCATTING

J. T. Donnellan Declares
New Camp Will Stand
for Truth Only
John T. Donnellan, one of the mining
experts of San Francisco, and one of
the pioneers of Goldfield, expresses
himself as flrm in the belief that Roch
ester is destined to be one of the great
est camps in the Sagebrush state. He
said yesterday:
""I have been through a half dozen or
more booms since Goldfleld, but there
never has , been any that Impressed me
more than Rochester. The new camp of
Nevada has as rich and big a surface
showing as any camp I ever saw, and
it gives every indication of going down
strong and of becoming another Tono
pah. It is. evident that this impression
prevails elsewhere, for the camp Is at
tracting big capital and there Is abun
dant money coming in for development
purposes'.""
Mr. Donnellan is the secretary of the
Rochester Crown Point Mines com
pany, whose territory is located in the
heart of the best part of the camp as
far as developed, and which has also a
long term lease upon a block of the
Nenzel property, which contains a part
of the vein system that has made the
Xenzel property what it is today.
On the Crown Point ground the com
pany has attained a depth of 42 feet
by shaft, sending the shaft ln # ore all
the way. The ore has been sacked to
a value of $60 per ton, the lower grades
being consigned to the' dumps for
future disposition. Mr. Donnellan
states that there are three men now in
the camp bent tipon installing mill fa
cilities for the district, and it Is to the
company's interests to set aside its
lower grade ores for milling, as there
is no limit set upon the removal of the
dumps in the contract of leasing.
The strength of the veins, and the
fact that the silver values predominate
over the gold, are factors that go to
convince those knowing Rochester that
the camp will be permanent with depth.
The croppings on the Crown Point
property pan as wide as 40 feet In
places , , and the croppings are extremely
bold, as can be seen by the numerous
photographs in the possession of Mr.
Donnellan.
The camp Is attracting , enormous
crowds, and those having , the interests
of the district at heart are determined
to prevent wildcatting In every way
possible. Mr. Donnellan says that all
figure the camp is , good enough when
gauged by actual conditions, and there
will not be permitted any orgy of
Illegitimate promotions.
C.H. M'INTOSH HEADS
FOUR NEW COMPANIES
Ready to Finance All Propo
sitions That Look Good
—And Many Do
The Rochester Mining Development
company was the first corporation of
its kind to put in an appearance in
the Rochester district and was formed
for the purpose of forwarding the min
ing development of the district by
financing all likely looking proposi
tions that might be brought forward.
This company is the fourth one pro
moted by.C. H. Mclntosh, who has be
come heavily interested in, the camp
and who has already formed three com
panies to work properties , which he
has taken over. It is a close corpora
tion, with Mclntosh as president; J. E.
McCreary, vice president; W. C. Pitt,
secretary and- treasurer. John Cleg
horn, one of the best practical miners
in the state, is manager of mine exami
nations for the company In the Inves
tigations of all properties.
McCreary is a retired oil capitalist of
Coalinga, Cal., and is , one of the wealth
iest ""men Interested In the camp. He
has been associated with Melntosh and
Pitt in their recent purchases and has
apparently decided to take up perma
nent interests in the camp and stay
with it for better or for worse.
The company was incorporated with
100,000 shares of stock at $1 per share
and $60,000 was fully subscribed, the
balance, or 40,000 shares, went Into the
treasury.
The purpose of the company is gen
eral exploration of the Rochester dis
trict and the looking over of all meri
torious propositions. The promotion
and building of a mill or mills will
come within the province of this com
pany.
This company has a department of
information with reliable information
about the camp for all who seek defi
nite mining Information.
ELY MEN TAKE OVER FIVE
CLAIMS FOR $25,000 CASH
ROCHESTER, March B.—Mining
and business men of Ely, Nev., took
hold of the Lake View group, compris
ing five claims, for a consideration of
$25,000. The View group, for
merly belonged to Sweeney & Dewitz.
This group is situated on Independence
hill, and right in the heart of Roches
ter. Big surface showings of high
value stand out prominently, and a
strong vein 5 feet in width is stripped
for 7i feet. The new owners will sink
a shaft 100 feet in depth Just as fast
as they can possibly get around to it.
The group has attracted considerable
attention from mining men in general.
TEN THOUSAND TONS
IN SIGHT IN BIG FOUR
One Lease Alone to Ship Ore
for Years to Come, Is
Prediction
Ten thousand tons of ore In nlpht
In the Big Four leajre on Nenxel peak*
with an eight foot vein running to an
average of $75 to the top, and the tun
nel of the Codd lease of th« Rochester
Hill* Mining company SO feet from th*
same ledge are indications of the pert
manency of the new camp of Rochester
and the bona fide support of the boost*
ing of the last few days. The Big Fou*
tunnel has been In ore for many weeks
and at last accounts had reached •
width of 12 feet.
The news has not been of a »n«*
tional nature, as the direct result*
prophesied by those familiar ■with the
outcroppings on Nenzel peak have ooma
to pass. The vein has widened and
the ore has become richer in lt« down
ward course and there is now not the
slightest doubt that the Rochester
Hills Mining company on the Codd
lease will strike the same ledge at the
same if not richer values.
The conclusions from the develop*
ments of the last week are simply to
the effect that the camp is assured of
shipping ore for years from these two
leases alone, and this conclusion is
reached in spite of the fact that devel
opment work has Just begun.
In addition to the siiowlngs on these
two properties, which may have been,
and promise to be the mainstay of the
camp, there are some excellent find
ings on other leases on the Crown
Point No. 1, besides many important
discoveries of the last week on ether
properties of the district.
VBRINGTOX COPPER MOTES
The Yerington Mountain Copper com
pany, operating about 12 miles east of
Yerington, has Its spur track on the
Nevada-California road, this side of
Schurz, completed and Is putting In ore
bins at an expense of about $2,000.
When these are completed the property
wlll be a heavy producer. Several thou
sand tons of ore are now piled on th»
dump at the mine awaiting hauling to
the railroad to be shipped to the smel
ter. This ore was all taken out In de
velopment work and the property is
proving - to be one of the big onea of
this district.
W. B. Boulter rave C. W. Geddes an
option on the Queen Charlotte group
of seven claims in the Mason Pass sec
tion. The price is $15,000 and the bond
is for one year. The sum of $2,000 was
paid down and the agreement call 3 for
a certain amount of work to be done
during the life of option. These claim*
are an extension of the McDonald
ground which Geddes already had un
der bond. There are some fine show

There is cheese from the United

poultry—in fact enough varieties of
cold storage edibles to fill menus for
a year.
One entire section of the exhibit

Los Angeles Produce
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17—Butter
dropped 2c a pound on the Los Ange
les produce exchange yesterday, go
-1 ing to 37c. This is nearer the proper
! quotation than it has reached for some
jtime, as it was largely through specu
lation that the price was forced up.
! Rather large receipts of the last few
| days were instrumental in sending the
| price down. There were no transac
tions in eggs or cheese yesterday, their
! prices remaining unchanged.
Dealers said yesterday that the
! demand for apples has picked up a
i little this week, but that there is still
. great room for improvement. One of
[ the large houses received a car of
Bellefleurs Monday and these were al
[ most cleaned up yesterday at $1.50 a
four-tier box. This was largely due,
: however, to the fact that there were
1 few Bellefleurs on the market before
| this and that they do not believe that
large quantities would be disposed of
I so quickly.
Pears, plums and peaches are rao
idly being celaned up on the market
and one of the large houses took the
last of their supply of nectarines out
of storage yesterday. There are only
a few more nectarines to come on the
market. All of these fruits are gradu
ally getting more expensive, as they
are gradually getting scarcer. Packed
boxes of Bartlett pears sold yesterday
for from $2.25 to $2.40.
Receipts of produce in Los Angeles
yesterday were: Eggs, 173 cases;
butter, 42,098 pounds; cheese, 496
pounds; cheese, 475 sacks; sweet po- ’
tatoes, 103 sacks; apples, 7243 boxes.
Following are the wholesale quota
tions:
The following egg and butter quo
tations are taken from actual sales 0:1

Butter—California creamery, ex
tras, 37c; creamery firsts, 32c.
Eggs—Local ranch, dozen, candled,
41c; case count, 38c; pullet eggs, 31c
dozen.
NEW Y'ORK, Sept. 17—The market
was without special feature today.
Trading was narrow and outside busi
! ness light. The weekly weather report 1
was sufficiently bullish to stimulrs
a fair volume of short covering, with
j the contracts furnished largely by
j local and southern spot houses. The
1 steady flow of hedge selling indicate- i
' that the basis is good and that the
: spinner is still buying liberally. Thir

Russian Tragedy.
(By United Press Associations.)
MOSCOW. Sept. 17.—Entering the
fashionable Taurida restuarant here,
J. J. Groshev, 26-year-old-son of a
wealthy merchant, ordered an elab
orate dinner with music, and sending
for his wife, stabbed her to death in
the presence of the manager, who had
poured out the champagne in which
Greshov had previously toasted his
wife. The musicians having been or
dered to play Tchalkowsky’s Autumn
Song, and the Russian song “Forgot
ten is the tender rose,” Greshov
pledged his wife and then killed l\er.
He made no attempt to evade arrest.
It is stated that the cause of the
crime was that he feared that his
wife intended divorcing him.
S. P. May Divorce
Wells Fargo Co.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17—The
Southern Pacific company, despite its
fight on behalf of Wells Fargo & Co.,
against the railroad commission’s
proposed slashing of interstate ex
press rates, may put an entirely dif
ferent angle on the express situation
in California, should the commission
uphold its recent decision.
According to a statement made by
one of the railroad officials today,
the Southern Pacific’s contract with
Wells Fargo expires in a few months
and if the commission upholds its at
; titude toward the express company the
railroad company will not only refuse
to be concerned in the court appeals ;
j but may also decline to renew a con- !
tract of any kind with the express j
utility.
The greater part of today’s hearing j
. before the commission was devoted!
by the Wells Fargo attorneys to an!

Wild Horses on Rampage
A new problem has come in that
wonderful pioneer region in Eastern
British Columbia, known as the Peace
River country. The Canadian Minis
ter of Agriculture has been urged to
take steps to protect settlers against
the depredations of wild horses which
have made raids upon the ranches
of new settlers, killing domestic horses
and leading away a number of
well-bred domestic mares which have
been imported at a considerable cost.
The wild horses are supposed to be the
descendants of horses abandoned dur
ing the gold rush to the Y’ukon terri
tory in 1897-8. From the Bow River
westward these animals have raided
the ranches of settlers as far west as
Kamloops and eten the contractors on
the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway have
been pestered by the mischevious stal
lions. I

Night School Is
Being Arranged
At a meeting of the trustees of Cen
tral Union high school last evening
it was decided to open a night school
within about two weeks if from a
dozen to fifteen pupils can be secured.
In that event an additional teacher
will be engaged and from two to two
and a half hours of instruction will
be furnished.
The night school will be especially
on commercial lines, it being the be
lief of the trustees that this course
will serve the greatest needs of the
people.
It is thought there are many young
men and women in the city who will
be glad to avail themselves of the op
portunity thus afforded.
Russians Victimized.
(By United Press Associations.)
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 17.
; Thousands of persons have just been
[victimized in a cleverly manipulated
land swindle, according to despatches
front Nakhitchevan. Circulars had
been sent out broadcast by a gang
of real estate agents, saying that the
! authorities had agreed to give 10 ! )
I square yards of land in a new town
site on the River Dor. nearby to every
i settler who should fence in his allot
| roent and promise to begin building
; operations within a reasonable time,
j The result was a pretty fair imitation
lof a western reservation opening in
ithe United States. Thousands stam
peded to the place where they were
met by the “agents” who assisted
I them in staking out the lots, and who
: sold them at high prices large quan-
I tities of fencing and building mater
i ial. The swindlers also sold and re
-1 sold lots among the settlers in return
for fancy commissions.
1 Next day the “agents” disappeared
just before the arrival of a detach
ment of police from Nakhitchevan
who proceeded to arrest the settlers
for occupying land without legal
authority. They not only lost their
claims but also the building mater
ials which they had purchased.
Elopes With Father.
(By United Press Associations.)
BERLIN, Sept. 17.—Fraulein Myra
Goersen’s father, a weajthy manufact
urer of Treptow, having refused to let
her marry Jacob Xaver, his former
clerk, the young lovers planned to
elope. Herr Goersen discovered the
plot but craftily kept silent. At the
appointed midnight Myra stealthily
opened the hall door and hopped into
a waiting motor car at the wheel of
which, much muffled up sat, as she
supposed, her Jacob. With finger to
bis lips he quietly steered the car into
the darkness. After an hour’s ride
the machine came to a sudden stop—
Myra’s own door. Her companion
stepped out, removed his goggles, and
laughed. It was her father. Just
then another car dashed up, bringing
the real Jacob, whom Papa Goersen
had misled as to hour by a fake mes
sage. Myra, promptly deciding that a
lover who was so stupid would proo
ably bungle matters as a husband, dis
missed hint on the spot, and entered
the house obediently on her father's
arm.
It's Horse Day.
(By United Press Associations.)
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept. 17.
Every horse in Cleveland has his day
today. The annual workhorse parade
was held here this afternoon and
thousands of horses were in line. The
parade has become a yearly event
ever since the big turnout of horses
in the Labor Day parade of 1911. Af
ter that it was decided that the horse
should have a day all his own. The
parade was almost three miles i.i
length. Prizes were awarded to the
best kept horses in the various classes.
Industrial exhibits and artistic floats
featured the parade.

Night Trains To
RunjjTo The City
It is reported that with the change
I in the time table of the Southern Pa
cific early in October the night trains
; will be operated directly between L«. s
Angeles and the valley, instead of
connecting with overland trains at th
junction.
For the last two years the ni._
cars to and from the valley have e
stituted so large a part of the < .
land trains with which they cornu
that it has interfered with the opera
tion of the overlands.
Last year it was necessary to pm
a second sleeper in commission to and
from the valley, and there is no dou;
that this season it will be necessary
to add at least one more sleeper, and
possibly two, making of the valley
cars a good sized train in themselves
To run the cars on a through train
would do away with considerable d
lay at the junction, shortening the
running time and making it possible
for the trains to leave the starting
points considerably later.
Perry Day in Cleveland.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept. 17.—To

the last minute whether press of busi
ness would keep him in Washington
or not. A program by a chorus of
1000 school children and a parade, in
which military, naval and frater
nal organizations participated were
scheduled.

SLAPSTICK GOLD
MINE NEXT ON
BILL
Comedian Joins Capitalist
and Will Exploit California
Mining Resources
Lulled I’renH I.enxeil Wire
LOS ANGELES, Fob. 2—Now for
a slapstick gold mine.
Announcement was made here today
that Mack Sennett, comedy king, had
entered partnership with two Los An
geles capitalists, Ed Featherstone and
A 1 Greenwald, in, operation of the
Normandie Mine in the Grass valley
district.
The Normandie is on American riv
er, 150 miles northeast of San Fran
cisco. one of the most famous gold
districts in the world. It was the
scene of the first gold rush in Cali
fornia.
Sennett returned to Los Angeles to
day from an inspection of his new
property. He brought with him a large
amount of gold bearing quartz, which
'he said assayed as high as SSOO a
ton. Operations were suspended on
the Sennet “lot” in Edendale while the
entire personnel of the “comedy can
nery” gathered to inspect the glitter
ing ore samples and to listen to
equally glittering tales of the Nor
'maridie.
A general stampede of comedians,
cameramen, directors and even the
“prop” department, from Allessandro
street to American river, seemed im
minent.
The Normandie already has a shaft
COO feet deep, with six tunnels* Sen
nett said. It is operating three <hif‘ :
a day. It is in.the same district oirh
the Empire and Lone Star name' in
terwoven with the history of one of
the maddest gold rushes in the world.
Sennett refused to be pinned down
as to whether his mine had been nam
ed for Mabel Normand.

other lui- a tract of the same size
which lie is planting to strawberries.
According to the rules laid down
for this project work, strictly bus
iness methods are employed in the
handling of these enterprises. The
keeping of correct accounts of all
expenditures and receipts is especi
ally emphasized. The number of
man-hours, the number of horse
hours, the rental of land, tools, etc.
are all taken into careful consider- .
afiou, so that when the work is
completed, the young agricultural
ists will know to the cent exactly
the percentage of profit or loss of
their ‘•farms.’

or refusing his offer of a purse of
$ 100,00(1 for a race between the

cent and plant husbandry, 25 •per
cent. About two thirds of the
class ting, is devoted to study and
discussion and the remainder, to
practical experiments. Field dem
on--trations and visits to the ranches
of farmers who are. successfully
practicing modern methods are fre
quently made. ' ..
At present, germination tests tire
being made on garden seed. Let
tine, t'liipu, beet, pen, and’carrot
seed have all been tested recently.
These tc-ts arc of great, praUiYal
value to the fanner, as they insure
him against having all the expense
of putting in a crop and getting
poor results because of the inferior
fa, clover, lettuce and other expens
quality of the seed planted. Alfal
fa. cover, ett ice and other expens
ive seed should be treated iu this
imiiim"" before planting.
Work contemplated this year will
include the making of a survey of
the date, citrus and other important
crops of the valley and a study ot
modern dairy methods, with special
attention placed on the use of up
to-date equipment and on sanita
tion. It is planned to give consid
erable time to the dairy work, as
it plays such an important part in
the industries of the county.
In the second year of the agri
cultural classes, a detailed study of
farm management and the economic
conditions ami factors which often
govern the success or failure of a
certain crop during a given .season
long before tlie seed is in the
ground is made.

DR. EDITH HOOK, FORMER EL CENTRO
WOMAN, WRITES A VIVID ACCOUNT OF
trip to mt. McKinley in Alaska
The many friends of Dr. Edith M.
Hook will be greatly interested in
reading the contents of a, recent let
ter received by Mrs. Mabel Edgar of
Imperial from Dr. Hook. Dr. Hook,
who practiced in El Centro for sev
eral years, left last summer for an
Alaskan trip and was so charmed
with the country that she opened up
an office in Anchorage where she
has been practicing ever since. Her
mother has been with her part of the
year but has returned again to Cali
fornia. It is understood that Dr.
Hook plans to return to Southern
California possibly late in the sum
mer.
Her letter describes in detail a
trip to Mt. McKinley, the highest
peak in North America, and is so
lengthy that it will apperfr in two
sections, the second section appear
ing in tomorrow’s issue of the
Press.
Hero letter follows herewith:
I never spent such an interesting
winter in my life. But the days are
getting longer now, the sub hot set
ting until 7:30 and twilight still
lingering until 9:00, so maybe we
can crowd a few' more things into
the 24 hours.
I have just returned from Mt. Mc-
Kinley National park where ! spent
a most delightful two weeks with
some friends of mine, so I’ll tell you
all about it.
Dr. Gregory, Mrs. Gregory, Mr.
Paul Borak and myself made up the
party. We went through the park,
by dog team, being the first tour
ists to have gone through in the
winter time. Mr. Borak had been
in the region seven years ago hunt
ing and trapping, just before it was
made a national park. He mushed
the dogs for us, being experienced
in that line.
Of course it was really the first
of April when we went, but since
the ice and snow and glacier forma
tions were still very much in evi
dence, we eall it winter time until
summer and its manifestations have
come, which same arrives sometime
in June in the park. ,
Anchorage is called the California
of Alaska because of the mildness
of its winters as compared to other
parts of Alaska, so the day was
bright and beautiful, with not a
cloud in the sky when we left here.
Our journey lay through the heart
of Alaska and the greater part of
two days was consumed in going
from here to Mt. McKinley park.
We passed through Matanuska
district which boasts the best farm
ing land in Alaska; Wasilla, where.

A
distinguished coffee
meets many
distinguished people
It is the glorious West that visitors from
abroad most want to see in America. Not
the least of the thrills they relate back home
is that “wonderful western coffee!” And
thus has +he coffee tradition spread to every
Old World capital.
You know their enthusiasm is well founded
the moment you break the vacuum seal of
a tin of Hills Bros. Red Can Coffee and re
lease that rare aroma. You are doubly sure
when you taste the flavor. As one zealot
said, “They may copy the can, but not its
contents 1”
With all its high quality, Hills Bros.
Coffde is not high-priced. It is economical to
buy—and economical to use. Hills Bros.,

Peak It 20,300 Peet High
At Talkeetna we received our first
glimpse of Mt. McKinley, the high
est peak on the North American eon
tinent, 20,300 feet in elevation. The
impression is that it is much higher,
the surrounding mountains being on
a low level, only a little above sea
level.
We stayed all night at Curry hotel
which is a very modern, up to date,
comfortable hotel.
The next morning was still, clear
and beautiful when we boarded the
trian at S o’clock.
We reached the deep snow belt
now and the snow-plow went ahead
of the train to clear the track of
snow many feet deep. The ther
mometer was below’ zero and a strong
wind was blowing which piled the
snow in drifts. 1 ,
Scenery Surpasses Alps
The scenery was great and far sur
passes anything in the Canadian
Rockies or the Swiss Alps, it is said.
Tall snow covered mountains and
deep snow drifted cayons, (among
them Hurrycane Gulch 350 feet
deep and as many wide, which re
minded me of Carisso Gorge except
for the snow), and many rivers
still frozen and white, all left im
pressions on the mind not to be for
gotten soon.
Section houses we passed, with
only their roofs showing above the
snow and having a cleared space
only at the station where a small bag
of mail and provisions were thrown
off to the waiting populace.
For two jiours in the afternoon we
were halted while the snowplow
tackled an especially stubborn drift.
Arriving at Mt. McKinley Park
■station we were met by Mr. H. P.
Karstens, the park superintendent,
with a horse-drawn sled to take, ns
to his home.
Mr. Karstens, with one other man.
holds the distinction of being the
only ones who have climbed Mt. Mc-
Kinley to its top, taking three
months to climb and three days to
descend. He is an old “sourdough” j
and pioneer of Alaska, first coming
to this country during the gold rush
days of the Klondyke, in J 879. He,
then was a boy of 20. Being a ■
strong, well built, young man of six
feet height, he came into promi
nence on the Chilkoot Pass, (a steep
rugged climb from Dyen to the sum
mit), as a packer. He made hun
dreds of trips up and down this pass,
carrying a pack of 125 pounds on
his back at one dollar a pound.
After making a little ‘‘stake”
ho proceeded on into the Klondyke
ami the Sevcnly-Milc country, so
called because of a river 70 miles
long running through it. Here he
was nicknamed ‘‘The Seventy Mile
Kid. ’ ’
In 1903, the year of the Fair
banks stampede, he went to the in
terior where he was a. prospector,
hunter, trader and trapper the ma
jority of which he did in the region
that is now Mt. McKinley National
park.
Wear Many Clothes
We stayed with Mr. and Mrs.
Karstens two days, enjoying true
Alaskan hospitality, before going on
by dog team to our camp 15 miles
away. The man used the two days
to break trail, taking some of the
provisions with them, one snow
shoeing ahead of the dogs, the other
‘‘mushing” the dogs over the trail
made.
The thermometer was still below
zero by 20 degrees with the wind as
strong as ever.
They cached the groceries seven
miles up, returning that night, ami
going on next day the rest of the
way ami returning again for Mrs.
Gregory ami me.
On the third day we all started
out for camp, our sled loaded down
with the remaining provisions and
Mrs. Gregory, who couldn’t walk
the 15 miles. We were all bundled
up to the cars. I, for instance, hav
ing on wool trousers, four sweaters,
a fur coat, five pair of hose, (two
next the skin of silk, then one pair
of silk and wool and the last two
pair of wool) inside my shoe pacs
beside the insoles to the pacs, tw’o
pair of wool gloves, a fur cap and
everything else I could get on too,
and then did not feel any too heav
ily clad.
We had a dog team of seven male- |
mute dogs, big, fine fellows all I
creamy white and all brothers or'
half brothers.
The leaders name was Boatswain ;
or “B’o’s’a’n”, named that, no I
doubt, because with the aid of the 1
first mate, or leader, the Captain or i
“musher” of the team was able i
to drive the ship or sled along to
safety. Then came Whity and Runt,
Hunter and Sandy, Red and Cay
enne, all being harnessed in pairs
except the leader.
These dogs are very intelligent•
and can do everything but talk.
They are very jealous of attentions I
given them and if you pet one you ■
must pet all. They will stand and I
whine and wag their bushy tails tin- i
til you have gone the . rounds, Al-|
though they are very friendly with
their caretakers they fight, Among
themselves and eannot be housed to
gether.
Alaskan dogs actually laugh in
their glee and pout when spoken to
harshly. As I said before, their ex
pressions are more human than any
other animals I have ever seen.
They are fed once a day only.
Each evening they are given a dog
salmon apiece. These dog- salmon
are caught in the Yukon River and I
are greatly relished by the dogs. |

SUGGESTIONS THAT
ARE USEFUL FOR
ALL HOME MAKERS
It is said that one aspiran tablet
dissolved in pwartn water and
poured in the bowl with cut flow
ers that are beginning to wither,
will freshen the most delicate
flower. | ;
i When finished with dishes that
have contained eggs, milk or flour,
i put them to soak in cold water.
, Dishes that have contained sugar
i or greasy articles should be soaked
[ in hot water.
A couple of cans of cream soup
should be on the reserve shelf.
Then when the dinner of leftovers
seems skimpy or unexpected com
pany selects the wrong night, to
drop in, that cream soup will prove
very filling and from a pretty good
foundation.
So many of the city folks have
to put up with hard water that is
so full of iron that it discolors the
article in which it stands. When
the water pitcher becomes brown
inside from this watey, let milk
stand in the pitcher until it turns
sour. It will take away all the sed
iment and discoloration.
SUMMER SALAD
Simmer 3 cups tomatoes, 1 minc
ed onion, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 tea
spoon salt, 1 or 2 eloves, a bit of
bay leaf, a few grains pepper, and
a little paprika for about 30 min
utes. Cool, strain, reheat and add
2 tablespoons gelatine softened in
•% cup cold water. Stir until gela
tine is dissolved. Set aside until
mixture begins to congeal and then
add 2 cups freshly cooked corn.
Pour into individual moulds, chill
and turn out on beds of crisp heart
lettuce and serve with mayonnaise
dressing.
CREAMED RADISHES
Wash 2 cups tender red radishes
and cook them in boiling salted
water until tender. Drain and mix
with ’4 cup cup well seasoned thick
white sauce.

Local Chamber Considers Proposed
Amendment to State Constitution
Giving Rights to Rural Districts
Consideration of the proposed
amendment to the constitution, of
the state of California in. which
there is Io be a renpportionment of
legislative districts to preserve Io
rural sections of the state eontroy
of one house of the legislature, is a
matter being taken up by the El Cen

The proposed amendment. has been
recommended to the various cham
bers of commerce that formed the
(general assemblage held in Los An
geles on April 18 and its support is
urged.
In explaining the reason for the
new plan,' the committee in charge
states: “The present provisions of
the constitution if carried out
would give control of both houses
of the legislature to three per cent
of the territory of the state—three
counties, Los Angelos, San Francis
co and Alameda —by reason of the,
dense population, 11 of the 22 larg
est cities of the state and 53 per
cent of the population of the state
being now located in those three
counties. This would mean that. 97

CLUBDOM NOTABLE
BLAMES U. S. HOME
FOR JAZZ REGIME
By I’tiUcil PreHR Lensed Wire
LOS ANGELES, June (>. —if the
young folk of today are a fast, gid
dy lot, Mrs. John I). Sherman, of
Estes Park, ('old., chairman of the
department of applied edifeation of
the general federation of women's
clubs, knows why.
Mrs. Sherman does not say tt.hc
oncoming generation is running
around in a dizzy whirl of dissipa
tion ami jazz, but if it is, the Am
erican home is responsible. That's
what she declared today, addressing
several thousand clubwomen as
sembled here in biennial convention.
Considering the fact that 'the
speaker is a candidate for the pre
sidency of the federation, and most
of the women she addressed are at
least 50-50 heads of homes, the in
dictment might, not have been con
sidered good politics by old-line
campaign managers.
“We hear a great deal of criti
cism these days of the younger
generation. With all the charges
that are brought against the young
people of the country, it seems
strange that we so seldom pause to
sum up the offences of the older
generation,” declared Mrs. Sher
man, swinging into the attack with
the courage of a crusader.
“As a matter of fact, if one
generation is at fault, so, inevitably,
is the other. If there is, in many
instances, a regrettable laxity of
attitude on the part of the young
people of the nation, if there are
forces which seem to menace the
physical and moral welfare ■ t the
younger generation, whose fault can
it. bo but the fault of the American
home ’
Less Home Life Today
“There is less real home life to
day in the true sense of the word
than ever before. There is less of
the respect for home, the old Jove
and reverence for home life that
makes the four walls a sacred ci
tadel.
The speaker said that more sys
tem in home work is needed, so
more “strength and inspiration may
be diverted from drudgery into the
more vital business of home-mak
ing.”
More attractive homes are also
needed, she declared, but that
alone is not sufficient to place the
home on the plane it deserves. “It
is the atmosphere inside the house
that is the most important thing.
The furnishings inay cost one thou
sand or ten thousand dollars, but
the result should be the same in
effect. There should bo that in
tangible something that radiates

“Under the proposed change, the
15 senatorial districts allowed the
the three populous counties would
he formed as nearly equal in popula
tion one with another, as may’ bo,
which, according to the census fig
ures of 1920 .would give Los An
geles eight, San Francisco four, and
Alameda three, with the further lim
itation, however, that no one city
have within its limits more than four
| senatorial districts. The purpose
i of this latter limitation is to insure
representation to the rural territory
of a county such as Los Angeles,
where otherwise most of the dis
trict to which the county was en
titled might be so formed as to bo
controlled by city population.”
The recommendations of the re

local chamber Wednesday night and

Traffic Squad
Rounds Up Three
Score Violators
Operations of the traffic squad
yesterday at Holtville resulted in
50 or 60 new registrations of mo
torists. Several drivers were re
quired to apply for transfers from
touring car to commercial car lic
enses.
Captain Shotwell stated this morn
ing that sufficient warning had
been given to motorists to have
their tail lights and license plates
placed in conformity with the law,
so that from now on violators will
be cited to appear before the jus
tice of the peace.
He stated that obscure license
plates included muddy plates, or
plates which are hidden behind
bumpers or are too far from the
tail light to be read at night.
Prof. Gilmore In
Short Address
at Elks Lodge
Prof. J. W. Gilmore of the Uni
versity of California, department of
agriculture appeared before mem
bersof the Elks lodge last night in
a short address on his impressions
of Sou'll America. Professor Gil
more particularly talked of Argen
tine and Chili, two countries he said
which are enjoying a lasting peace.
Professor Gilmore said that he
had visited the monument of Christ
placed high in the Andes at the
border between the two countries
and symbolizing a lasting peace.
The monument was constructed
after the two countries had spent
years in fighting over the location
of the border line. It was finally
decided to appoint three arbiters
from each nation and after a on
fereuce of several months th* com
mission hit upon the plan ■ the
monument.

Mrs. Sherman's address was one
feature on a series of division pro

subject of “The American Home”
will be the topic of another address
tonight, delivered by Dr. Aurelia
Henry Reinhardt. president of

The New Year’s party is char
| aetcri/'cd by noise and merriment.
1 Hons mid whistles and bells are
,-1 as essential a part of the plans
.s the guests ~r the refreshments.
One i t the in os i joli.v New A car’s
•Vi celebrations that we ever at
tended was a two faced party. 1 lie
gin w . a -kc' I ' come dressed
in don - with masks, one for tlie
back of the hind to face the old
vc i mill one for the front to look
forward into the new year. Oil
ai riving each guest was given a
number to pin on and a card con
taining a Lst of all the numbers,
■no. when nil were assembled a
i nti'sj wa - held t guess who was
who. I:i order t> give the guessers
a duo to the identity of the indi
vid :ais. cadi person was requested
to recite this favorite New- Year
poem: v *•""
•ii.cg out the lid, ring in the new,
Ring happy hells across the snow;
The vein is going, let him go.
King out the false, ring in the true.”
One person with a black false
face recited it in negro dialect, one
w'th n little girl’s face lisped the
nes and one man who wore a
indy's face tried to recite it in a
deceiving falsetto tone, all of which
added to the fun.
After each guest had written his
guesses opp -ite the numbers on
the card, given him at the begin
gof th e itest, the face masks
were iimoved, but the one on the
Li i k of the head was left oil.
I : ere was a prize, of course, for
;he person who guessed the identity
of the greatest number of persons.
Games followed, ninny of which
w. , arranged ti be played back
ward. There was a snowball Idttie
with .-nowballs made of cotton bnt
' eg sprinkled with artificial snow.
The guests, divided into two sides,
were lined up with the masks on
the hack of of their heads facing
towa.d each otlo r. In this position
tiny threw th snowballs from one
side . * the other.
A gi -at deal of fun was derived
from making the guests, one at a
time, try to wall; a elialkliiie with
the false face forward, which really
meant walking backward.
Just before twelve, favors wore
distributed.. They consisted of pa
per hats and horns, mouth organs,
drums, whistles and bells, and as
t! ,- clock struck the witching hour
of midnight a no'-y parade started
which ended as the supper table.
A men i suitable for such a party

Public Notice
To Everyone In The Valley
Are You Thinking of Buying a New Machine?
Before You Do, There Is a Lot of Things to Learn
The selling of sewing machines is unlike that of any other
merchandising scheme. If you know the ropes; however, there
is not so much danger of being taken in.
While warmed up with enthusiasm the average machine
agent does not mention the weak points of his machine. He is too
interested in you giving him $75.00 to $150.00 for a new machine,
that might not do as well as your old one.
I’m your benefactor. From me you’ll get BOTH sides of the
story. I will prove that your old machine can be cleaned and
made to serve your purpose BETTER than a new one.
I Am Interested In You.
I will give you advice, help and consultation for which I never
charge a penny. Fourteen years ago I dedicated rpy life to help
people. It is a profession with me. John £), Mrs.
Newton D. Baker, wife of General McQuigg, and
other delighted customers would quickly tell you what 1 did for
them. •' ~ v 1 "" ;
: *:IS , . .
Ninety-nine per cent of the sewing machines'in Imperial
County should be cleaned and overhauled. But you are jtist like
everyone else, afraid to call in a sewing machine agent,'because
you know what they always try to do.
Like a Big Brother, I will protect you against seivlng ma
chine fakers and others who are just after your money. When I
say I will overhaul your machine and give it a thbrotigh French
Cleaning right in your own home for almost nothing, (just
$1.90;) when the regular price is $5.00, prdves that rtloney is no
object to me during this advertising campaign/ 1 *'' '
Expect to be busy in my room at the hotel most of,the time
evenings till 9 o’clock until Wednesday. Suppose you call
up and give me your name? I know just how you feel about the
matter, so I promise to come and givfe your machine a FREE
examination. The things I do for you will make you happy—
you 11 say so yourself. A perfect running machine is a God-Send.
Call in person, write or phone your name AT QNCE.

There’s Mo Guesswork
About Goodyears
—Some folks are still buying tires under the de
lusion that they can outsmart the other fellow
at his own game.
—They get a kick out of it, i suppose. Yet it
seems to me that the old shell racket was a far
easier game to beat. Then, you’ll recaii, there
were only three shells to outguess while today
there are more different tires and more differ
ent prices than you can shake a stick at.

Xorge encounter fog near Alaska
it might return to Spitzbergen, tint
today's reports, indicating the ship
was nearing the end of its voyage at
Xonie, apparently meant such n
change of plan would riot ho neces
sary.
Alaska awaited the coming of the
Xorge with an interest and a tensity
of excitement which hardly lias been
equalled since ttie* days of the gold
rush
1 Xome folks have seen airplanes,
but never lighter than air craft,
and the strangeness of the expected
visitor, combined wit], the fact that
it is coming from the other side of
the world across the pole, as no one
las ever done -Jjpfore, adds to the
citv’s interest.
There was little sleep in Xome
last night. Tt was daylight, any
way. and no one took a clianee on
missing first sight of the Xorge.
About the only persons who re
m,-lined indoors were radio opern
*ors, straining to catch some signal
from the croft. There was much
static interference, and stations
’•ere so far have failed to talk with
Hie dirigible.
Nome Is Decorated
Main streets of the town have
been decorated with flags and bunt
ing .and a triumphal arch erected
through which Pant ain Amundsen
Mid his 10 men will pass.
Outside tlie town .a special land
ing field Ims been prepared and 100
men have been designated to grab
Hie ropes of the Xorge as it comes
down and bring it to earth, a tri
umphant victor in a new adventure.
The landing field has been cleared
off and the name “Xorge” spell
ed in white letters 25 feet whigh.
Belief here is that Hie expedition
ni'v be floating around over the
unknown spaces this side of the pole
that great blank region on the
•virH's maps which is one third the
‘■'ze of the United States in area and
has never been explore,] by man.*
May Be lata Tomorrow
That was Amundsen’s goal, ae

his denarture, and if the Xorge is
“marking time” over the Arctic

The St. Paul operator reported
the Xorge's signals were very weak.

All-ha. red-blooded romance is not yet dead! Duelling challenges still
i are being flung about by irate champions of womanhood, and here you see
two reasons for two recent ones. Because Dolores del Rio, left, is travel
ing about Europe with her mother and Edwin Carewe, movie director, the
film actress' former husband is claimed to have invited Carewe to per
sonal combat. Inset id Princess Astride, of Belgium, whose short skirts
brought a public reprimand from a priest. He, in turn, was challenged by
: an unnamed Belgium commoner.

IMPERIAL VALLEY NEEDS
—The whole hearted support of every resident here.
—A federal farm loan bank.
—A federal building.
—More resident landowners, and less renters.
—Development of its resources.
Nineteen hours from New York to Los Angeles is
remarkably fast time yet the record set yesterday by
Captain Frank Hawks, who flew the distance in that
time, is not likely to stand for any lengthy time.
His actual flying time was 19 hours, 10 minutes
and 28 seconds, or five hours, 40 minutes and. 32 seconds
faster than the best previous time made by the late Cap
tain Col Iyer and Harry Tucker.
£aptain Hawks’ plans to return immediately to
New York in an attempt to make a round trip flight in
less than 36 hours, have been held up as this is written,
pending slight repairs to his plane. Neither the pilot
nor his plane seemed bothered by the long and fast
flight.
The aviator’s average speed was only 135 miles
an hour over a course estimated to be 2,506 miles, in
dicating that the chances for even faster time between
the two coasts are remarkably good.
Recently we read a series of letters written by one
of the argonauts of ’49 who made the trip from New
York to California during the gold rush. Believing the
long trip overland, or the other two routes around
Cape Horn or across the Isthmus of Panama, were too
difficult, this man went by boat to Galveston, thence
overland across Texas and Mexico to the west coast
and up the coast by ship to Santa Barbara.
The journey required several months and those
who made it suffered terrible hardships. More than
a score perished on the way from cholera, while hostile
Indians and other dangers menaced the party at all
times. Even these hardships were not comparable,
the agonaut wrote, to the tediousness of the long slow
trip.
Contrasting his experience with that of Captain
Hawks shows the progress that has been made. Aside
from the natural fatigue one would have from a long
day’s w’ork, or even driving an automobile, Hawks suf
fered no hardship. He made the entire distance in the
same time that would enable the argonaut to make 40
miles if all went w’ell.
In spite of ail that has been and will be written
about forest fires, thousands of acres of California
timber land are doubtless doomed to be destroyed this
summer, causing- a heavy monetary loss and a scenic
loss that cannot be calculated.
Some of this waste it is not possible to prevent, but
statistics show' that the great majority of forest fires
are caused by carelessness. Campers fail to extinguish
their fires, smokers throw cigar and cigarette butts
away; matches are carelessly dropped into dry leaves.
Each year a strenuous campaign is carried on by
state authorities and semi-public organizations, urging
the public to use the greatest care with fire when they
are near timbered country.
Valley residents can w'ell recall the fires of last
year which destroyed hundreds of acres of land in the
mountains west of us. The scars left by the fire are
still to be seen. Fires have already been reported
this season in these mountains.
Our county has no timber land to be destroyed
but the anti-fire propaganda applies just as strongly to
us as to residents in any other part of the state, perhaps
m.oreso. Having no forests of our own to guard, we
may be tempted into carelessness when visiting tim
bered areas ip other parts of the state.
Strict compliance with the forestry regulations
when visiting the w'ooded sections should be the aim of
every valleyite this summer. It may be something of
a hardship to have to refrain from smoking while visit
ing summer resorts, but those in charge of the forests
know that it is absolutely necessary to safety.
Careful watching of camp fires, matches and
smoking material will do much to avoid disaster.
Figures published in the news column of this issue,
show without doubt that El Centro needs another
artery through its business section to relieve the heavy
traffic across the railroad tracks at Commercial and
Main streets.
They indicate that during the noon hour in one
day, an average of 10 vehicles cross the tracks at
Main street each minute. A total of nearly 8,000
vehicles crossed during a 24 hour period. These fig
ures may not seem so astounding now, but they are as
low as they ever will be. That they will be much
higher a few years hence is not to be doubted.
Commercial street crossing figures were some
what lower nearly 2,000 vehicles crossing the tracks.
At Main street, during the checking period, 177 trains
crossed over the highway; at Commercial street the
figure was 319.
The object of the check was to obtain reliable and
accurate figures on traffic for use of the state railroad
commission, which is to give a decision in the near
future on the plan to extend State street across the
railroad.
Since Eighth street was paved, commercial traf
fic through State street has increased heavily. Traf
fic headed into the city is practically all destined for
the industrial section on the east side, and must be
detoured either to Main street or to Orange street be
fore it gets there. A cut through to the east Bide on
State street will relieve the burden on Main street by
a goodly percentage now and by a much heavier per
centage in the future. It is also well to point out that
the extension can undoubtedly be done cheaper now
than it can m the future.

UNCLE WIOKSILY AND THE |
CAT BIRD
“Mew! Mew!” tried the pussy

“Bow! Wow!” narked the do;*.
“I>,ar me!” exclaimed t’ncie
Wigg'.lv. “More trouble next doo-!
My! My! Why does that dog always
want to chase the poor cat?”
For that is what had happened.
Near Uncle Wiggiiy’s hollow
slump bungalow on one side live 1
a pussy cat. On the other side ofj
the bungalow, a few house? away,;
lived a lively dog. No, it was neither,
Jackie nor Peetie Bow Wow, t hough
when the dog barked, as lie very;
often did, at the pussy eat, lit

two little puppies about whom 1
have told you some stories. \

W ow.
As for the pussy cat, she was
real cute and never gave any;
trouble. She would purr when you;
stroked her hack or rubbed he'
ears, and she would mew when she
was hungry and wanted a diink oi ;
milk. But she would mew much]
louder when the dog chased lew,
which lie did every time lie got a
chance.
The pussy cat used to come out
on her back stejis. She would
switch her tail in the sunshine,
then she would stretch out one leg
after the other and next she would

THAT’S WILLIE’S LITTLE WEAKNESS NOW!
near Ins kennel on the other side
of Uncle MTiggily’s bungalow,
heard the mewing of tlie pussy cat,
that dog would awaken suddenly,
jump to his feet and growl:
“Ha! A cat! I must chase her up
a tree!' ’
With that the dog would juu.p
over 1 is fence into Uncle Wiggily’s
yard, jump the next two or three
fences until lie was in the yard of
the house where the pussy cat
lived. And then —dear me! Win.
sad things would happen!
With a woof and a growl and a
bark (lie dug would rush at tli<* poor
pussy cut sitting in the sun on Iter
' steps. And as soon as she saw and
heard that dog coming the pussy
i cat would push up her back in the
j middle like a funny little Chinese
bridge, her tail would swell up as
Tfiffl iMUfttIAL VALLKt PRKS&
large as a bologna sausage anil she:
would open her mouth and hiss.
Then if the dog still dashed at •
her, which he almost always did,!
the pussy cat would run up a tree*
and stay there until the dog grew
tired»of waltzing around and bark
ing.
“It’s a good thing for us cats
that dogs can't climb trees, - ’ the
I«ior pussy would say to herself.
Well, this morning I am telling
| you about. Uncle Wiggijy heard tin
i mewing of the pussy, he heard the
l barking of the dog, and then he
j heard the scrabbling of the dog’s
paw nails as he jumped the fence.
Uo heard the hissing of the pussy
and the scratching of her da .vs
as she climbed the tree to get away
from the dug. No wonder the tab
! bit said:
j “More trouble next door!”
J Then Unde Wiggily went out in
, his yard and called to the dog:
j “Why do you always chase that
j poor cat?”
■ “Oil, I just can’t help it!” baik
i ed the dog. “I don’t want to bite
her. I just like to chase her to see
! her run up a tree.”
“Well, I wish . you’d stop!’’
I mewed the pussy, now up in the
1 branches. “And I’d just like to see
, you try to bite me! I'd seratdi your
* nose good for vou! Mew! Mew!
Mew!”
“ Gurr-r-r-r! ” growled the dog,
as he jumped back to bis own yard,
“Can’t you do something to help
me. Unde Wiggily?” asked Ihr
pussy as she climbed down out ot
the tie*\ “ I'in tired of being chas
ed by that dog every time I mini
out i’ii my steps. Can’t you inal:<

It has been known for several
weeks that a deal was pending
whereby H. 11. Peterson was to ac
quire tlie northeast corner of Impe

K. C. Paulin and the former now an
nounces that the deni is consummat

June 28, 1914
All sections of the valley met in

the best means of river control and
after much limited discussion, Philo
Jones proposed that the whole mat

received unanimous approval.

and twinkled his pink nose. Then
a|| of a sudden, up in the top of the
tree, he heard:
“Mew! Mow! Mew!”
“Why, there's another cat up
there!” cried the pussy. “That dog
must have ehased her up there be
fore he chased me. Listen!
Uncle Wiggily listened. Again he
heard:
“Mew! Mew! Mew!”
“That’s a eat bird, but not a
cat,” said the rabbit to tin; pussy
who had been chased by the dog.
“It is a jolly cat bird and now I
think I know a way to teach that

“Mew! Mew! Mew!” called the
slate colored bird as down he flew.
“iHin’f be afraid of this pussy, ’
said Uncle Wiggily. “I want you

“All right,” sang the Cat Bird.

In the olden days, husbandry was
looked upon as an ancient, and hon
orable vqcation and we find today
that, as a man makes his fortune, ho
wants to ‘go back to the soil.’ As
a result, wq have a number of es
tates, running up into big capital in
vestment, These people are classi
fied as ‘retired’ and so far as that
class is concerned, the farm is not
de|>endod upon for an incomej it's
more of a hobby, and in order to
enjoy a life of ease and freedom
from responsibility, surrounded by
tile things that w« most cherish, but
that is getting clear avvA"" from the
question of farming for a living and
when we deal with the latter we aro
confronted immediately with the
fact that there is a tremendous dif
ference between farmers in one sec
tion of the country and farmers in
another section, where the condi
tions of soil, climate, growing per
iod and marketing are vastly differ
ent.
It would be interesting, especially
in the great open west, uml south
west, to know how the farmer or
rancher spends his tune after har
vesting the seasonal crop and even
during the growing and maturing
season. We must consider that most
of our bind, due to a lack of fertili
zation, docs well to produce one nor
mal crop. Isn’t it expecting a lot
(to assume that any klud of land,
anywhere, will, within the usual six
months’ tilling, planting_and grow
ing season, produce enough to war
rant a layoff during the balance of
the year? Is there imv business
(lint will produce sufficiently and
will progress and prosper without
the continued application of a good
deal of brain and brawn.
In the middle west, forage and ]
grain are used to a very great ex
tent in finishing some form of live
stock, thus the fnrmer has all occu
pation —in fact, that is the method
of marketing the bulk of the pro
duction; namely, through the modi
um of live stock. It not only fur
nishes employment hut it is re
garded as an essential part of farm
ing and the live stock feature is
generally considered as the chance
for profit or loss. The recent big
break in wheat prices demonstrated
the wisdom of feeding live stock
because if the farmer ii forced to
sell hi* grain, lie is immediately con
fronted with a loss, hut in feeding
llie grain to live stock, an addition
al outlet is made available; hence,
another chance for profit.
Live stock provides a diversifica
tion with cash available when most
needed ’tween seasons. Most <>f
all. it puts something back into,the
•soil. So essential to continued pro
rduction. As we build up the soil,
i we then prepare for increased pro
duction and diversification and this
; situation may justify our staying at
home II little more to get acquainted
! with what the land will really do
with a little help. Animal life on

real start of Christmas shopping, from
now umil Christmas day. the work ot
those who sell and transport merenan
. increase tremendously.
As is true with us in so many other
activities. Americans crowd an immense
amount of O'iort and energy into a com
nnratively short space of time and ]
heavy burden upon those who must
handle the Christmas rush.
It is necessary to augment the ordin
al*' > in order to move an im
mense amount of matter thousands of
miles in hundreds ot hours, but even
then a terrible strain is placed upon each
individual engaged in the undertaking.
“Do your Christmas shopping early.'
is not an idle request. Behind it is a bit
of idealism which many of us overlook
with alarming consistency—a little con
sideration for the ether fellow.
It is just as easy to buy now as it is
the day before Christmas, and the selec
tion afforded the purchaser is much
greater. It is also possible for many to
make their purchases in the morning in
stead of waiting until closing time in the
afternoon. Clerks are going to be more
tired the day before Christmas than they
are now. Much of the fatigue they will
experience in the next few weeks comes
from the thoughtless shopper who rush
es in late in the day and insists upon be
ing cared for before closing time.
The same conditions apply to mail and
express clerks. Their work can be made
much lighter if the general public will
send Christmas gifts intended for dis
tant places now, instead of waiting un
til Christmas week. And dumping an
avalanche of packages on mail and ex
press clerks late in the day is not what
might be called showing the true Christ
mas spirit.
There is need for all of us to remem
ber that the spirit of Christmas should
not be restricted by us to relatives and
immediate friends but should take in
VISITOR HERE TELLS OF EARLY
DAYS ON BUTTERFIELD ROUTE
Inhabitants of this, the machine
age. should toss mere utility to the
winds and follow in the footsteps ol
those who have gone before and
route the Imperial highway along
ihe old Butterfield trail, in the
opinion of Reverdy Harris, who was
here to attend a meeting ol the
Imperial Highway Association Sat-
urday.
“Trails established before the
memory of man. before historical
records, should be followed by us
today in order that they may not
be lost in oblivion,” Harris said.
Long before the Butterfield stages
toiled along this route, game trails
marked its line. Then came the In
dians following the game to water
and to grazing spots. Spaniards and
Mexicans followed it next enroute
to the coast. The Mormon cara
vans and 25,000 immigrants trod the
dust of this historic trail during
California's most stirring and ro
mantic days. It is for us to pre
serve the highway which played so
important a part in the development
of the state.
“The soil of the trail is hallowed
by the footsteps of valiant pioneers
and stained with the blood o. mar
tyrs to progress and development.
Men, women and children died
along its tortuous course, and their

lose this opportunity to erect a
monument to their memory.”
Harris has a deep interest in the
route, as his mother traveled it in
1850. She ran away from her home
in Fort Worth. Texas, and hid m a
wagon train headed for California.
She left a diary telling of the jour
ney to California, the account con
taining a vivid description of the
journey across Imperial Valley and
the hardships encountered in this
vicinity. She wrote of the five-day
journey from Yuma by cx team to
Indian Wells. Upon arrival a: the
wells, to which they had been di
rected by outriders, it was discovered
that a sand storm had covered them
with sand and there was no water.
The travelers were forced to turn
the stock loose, abandon the wa
gons at Indian Wells and make the
trip to Carriso Creek on foot.
In 1892, Harris came with a party
of friends along the Butterfield
trail with the p.an to sink a well
at Indian Wells and settle the coun
try. They hauled in their tco;s and
near the old stage station sank a
well 280 feet deep when water was
discovered. The water, however, was
salty. They abandoned their tool:
and left the country, as they cor.-

COI'XTY Pin SIC! AX EX PL uxs
In the news columns of today’s issue
of the Press appears a letter from the
county physician, explaining the course
taken in connection with the case of an
unfortunate individual who committed
suicide in the local jail last week and
which was the cause of an editorial in
this column.
It appears from this letter that coun
ty officials connected with the case did
all that might have been done under the
circumstances and acted consistently
with regard to the welfare of the indi
vidual and protection of the county.
The facts as explained by the physi
cian are somewhat at variance with the
details as first given the Press from .#
source which it believed to be authentic
but which it feels free to state could ot
be as familiar with the case as the county
physician.
In view of the criticism received at this
office from a number of individuals and
the comment heard in numerous places
regarding the case, we are glad that the
comment by this column prompted the
physicians explanation.
As this is too lengthy to be given here,
the attention of readers is directed to the
news columns where it has been placed.

VALLEY REMAINS
WHITE SPOT ON
BUSINESS MAP
Although! the white area around
Imperial Valley has decreased in
the November 1 business condition
map ol ""Nation's Business"". Imper
ial Valley itself remains in the
white this month, reflecting good
business conditions in this commun
ity as has been done for the past
It! months. Tire decrease in the
size of the white spot which has
included the valley for some months
is due to the fact that Yuma Valley
is this month shaded gray, indicat
ing only fair business conditions,
due no doubt to the closing of the
two banks recently in that terri
tory. One of the outstanding indi
cations of prosperity in this county
,s the fact that building permits
m El Centro. Brawlev and Calexico
have set new records this year,
while building permits for the na
tion as a whole the first nine
months of this year are the lowest
since 1921.
The nation as a whole shows few
er black, or quiet spots on the map
and the west has two new White
spots, on? at Monterey and cue in
southern Idaho, with two new
clack spots also, one in Montana
and one in Colorado.
Frank Greene, managing editor of
Bradstreet’s, who prepares the bus
iness condition map. states that
there is fairly abundant evidence
that distributive trade has actually
thrown off the lethargy of late sum
mer and is to that extent tetter
situated than it was. Ke also states
that, according fo the report of th?
Savings Bank Division of the Am
erican Bankers' Association mads
public early in November, deposits
in tne fiscal year ending Juns 30.
1930. had increased by $267,130,000.
reaching the highest point ever re
corded. It is this class of deposits
which civic organizations, among
which is the El Centro Chamber of
Commerce are trying to discour
age as it is necessary to put this
money into circulation of btisin.ss is
to be improved.
Greene has been in close corres
pondence with Robert Hays, man
ager of the local chamber, for the
past month, checking carefully
whether or not Imperial county
! deserves to remain in the “white”
lon th ""Nation's Business” map,
and the *act that he has again left
this section in that color indicates
that lccal business conditions are
sound and encouraging as Greene
checks all sources with an unbiased
mind and gives credit only where
it is due.
JUDGMENT DENIED
ENGLISH ACTRESS
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1. (U.R)—
Beatrice Lillie, English stage aid
screen actress, in private wife the
wife of Sir Robert Peel, is not en
titled to a judgment of SIOO.OXI
against Warner Brothers Motion
Picturec ompany for alleged dam
age to her reputation. Judge Doug
las Edmonds found in a decision
on file in superior court today.
The case was thrown out of court,
after Miss Lillie had introduced
testimony to show that she alleg
edly was employed by Warner
Brothers to make a skit for a pic
ture, ""Show of Shows,"" and that
the skit instead was shown as a
short-subject. Defense held that
the actress had no cause for action
in that reputation in the eyes of
the law can be damaged only by
s'ander or libel.

UNCLE WIGGILY S SNOW
HOUSE
Dear me! Do you know what day
this is?"" asked Uncle Wiggily of
his wife as he sat at the breakfast
table in the hollow stump bunga
low one morning, reading the pap
er ""Do you know what day it is?""
Why it's Monday, of course,”
answered the rabbit lady reaching
over to get a little more maple sug
ar for her carrot coffee.
• And it s wash day if you ask
me!"" squeaked Nurse Jane Fuzzy,
the muskrat lady housekeeper. ""I'm
going to be very busy. I don't see
what there is special about today
that Uncle Wiggily makes such a
fuss,"" went on Nurse Jane.
""Only that today is the first of
December.” said Uncle Wiggily with
a twinkle of his pink nose “This
is Christmas month—the start of
Christmas month and. in about
thiee weeks more Santa Claus will
be here. Ha! H 3! Isn't that jolly!""
Then Nurse Jane laughed and so
did Mrs. Longears and all the little
bunny boys and girls, from Jingle
and Jangle all the way down to
Baby Buntv, the little orphan rab
bit—they all laughed as hard as
Here is my show house !
they could, for they knew what
Christmas meant.
“Well, now I think I'll take a
hop around my bungalow and look
for an adventure,'’ said Uncle Wig
giiy when the bunny boys and girls
had hopped away to school, to re
cite their lessons to the Lady Mouse
Teacher. ""Something may happen!”
and Mr. Longears went out whlstle
ing.
Winter had come early that year
and, though it was only the first
of December, there was snow on
the ground. On the way to school
the rabbit children had made
snowballs and they had found won
derful, slippery places where they
slid on their toeses and sometimes
on their noses.
“I know what 111 do to make me
think of Christmas!” gaily cried
Uncle Wiggiiy. “I’ll build me a
snow house.”
Out back of the bungalow, where
there was plenty of snow, Mr.
Longears began to build the white
house. With a shovel he first piled
the snow into a great heap, or drift,
pointed at the top like a Hallowe’en
hat. Then he dug a hole on one
side of the drift, scooped out all the
snow he could and soon he had
room enough so he could go inside.
“And there is even room for com
pany If I should happen to have
any visitors,” said the rabbit gentle
man as he made a chair out of
some old icicles. “I’ll just sit here
and w'ait a while to see what hap
pens.”
So Uncle Wiggiiy sat in his snow
house, on the icicle chair. It was
cozy inside, but cold, for that’s the
way with snow houses. But Uncle
Wiggiiy had on his warm fur coat
so he didn't mind.
After a while Mr. Longears heard
a sniffing and snuffing at the door '
of his snow house.
“Ah,” he thought. “Here is com- j
pany. Ccmc in!” he invited, poli- j
tely. and then he wished he hadn't'
been so quick. For instead of good
company coming in there entered i
the Fuzzy Fox, who was bad com-1
pany.
""Oh, ho!"" growled the Fox, look
ing at the rabbit. “This is a most
unexpected pleasure.”
“What did you say? What does
unexpected pleasure mean?"" asked
Uncle Wiggiiy. He knew perfectly
well, but he thought if he could
get the Fox to talking, showing off
how smart he was, there might be
a chance to get away. And the Fox
said:
""Unexpected pleasure means I
didn't think I'd find you here. But
I have and now I'm going to ""
""Have a chair!” interrupted
Uncle Wiggily, getting up off the
icicle one and offering it to his
company most politely.
""I will!"" growled the Fox. “I'll sit
here and look at you to make up
my mind which ear to nibble first.""
So he sat down and Uncle Wiggily
stood up in the snow house and, all
of a sudden the Fox snarled: ""It’s
chilly in here. I'm catching cold—
ker-choo! Ker-foo!""
""Why don’t you make a fire be
fore you nibble me?"" asked Uncle
Wiggily. ""There is some wood,"" and
he pointed to some sticks on the
white house floor, for the rabbit
gentleman had scraped the ground
bare whe nhe scooned out his snow
tent. ""Make a good, hot fire!""
""I will,” said the silly Fox. ""Then
I'll nibble you!"" So the Fox heaped
up some sticks, lighted them with
a match he had in his pocket and
then he sat down in the icicle chair
again to wait for the fire to get
hot, which it soon did.
Uncle Wiggily stood near the
door and. all of a sudden the rabb't
gentleman noticed that the fire was
making the snow house melt, just
as he knew it would when he told
the Fox to make it. Then, just as
the snow house began to turn to
I water, and cave in. Uncle Wiggily
] jumped outside and ran to his bun
galow. And the snow house melted
! and tumbled in right on. top of the
I Fox. covering him from sight and
;he caught a dreadful cold. So he
i didn't nibble the rabbit after ail.
! And if the coal shovel will bring
1 some sugar up out of the salt cellar
to sprinkle on the dill pickle so it
, won’t be scur. I'll tell you next
' about Uncle Wiggily's good bunnies.

Householders of Imperial Valley
who wake up in the morning with
a chill creeping into their bones
should listen to the story of John
C. Neale, city clerk, and go th'ir

Neale recently returned from a
deer hunt into the Kaibao forest in
Arizona, bringing back a tnie of
snow covering the ground and
weather that held the thermometer
below zero.
One foot of snow was on the
ground when the city clerk and his
party arrived in the Kaibab <oun
try, and only the night before their
arrival the mercury dropped to 10
degrees below zero.
The party left Thursday night of

BRAWLEY EL CENTRO CALEXICO
lof Superstition may never return,
'say the Indians, who have held the
j range in awe for generations, and
! in many cases that has been true.
A powerful magnet has drawn
white men into the recesses of the
mountain for more than 50 years.
Back there among the sheer, rocky
crags is concealed a gold mine of
fabulous value. It is known as ""The
Lost Dutchman. - '
For years Ruth worked in Wash
ington and dreamed of one day
finding the phantom-like mine. Two
weeks ago he packed back from
Apache junction. Packers were in
structed to meet him with addition
al supplies. He failed to appear.
Alarm was felt and yesterday a sys
tematic hunt started.
Sheriff Walter E. Lavecn of Pinal
county assigned Gabriel Robles, a
Mexican tracker, to lead the posSe.
He is a peer among mountain men
but freely admits there is a lot
about Superstition he doesn't know.
""We will do our utmost,'' Sheriff
Laveen told the United Press. ""The
odds are about one in a 100 of find
ing him. That is peculiar country.
Canyons load to the Up of the
cliffs. You could be within 10 feet
of a man and never sec him.""
Indians, if value as guides in
j most instances of this nature, arc
' worthless in the present case. Like
their savage ancestors, Indians fear
Superstition and will not venture
; near it.
The mine, sought so earnestly and
I tragically, was located and worked
by a Dutchman more than a half
‘ century ago. He used to come front
the hills with gold-laden bags and,
..or hiring supplies, slipped into
the hills again.
Rumors Prove Fake'
After one trip the Dutchman dis-
I appeared and prospectors from all
i parts of the west started hunting
for his mine. It has been reported
! found perhaps a thousand times,
1 causing new gold rushes, but time
always proved the error of such re
ports.
Not even the approximate loca
tion of “The Lost Dutchman” is
known. Somewhere, in a vast terri
tory of sky-scrapping peaks and
lowly canyon floors it exists.
Superstition is a forbidding coun
try to veteran mountaineers. Ex
perienced prospectors, knowing the
character of the country and
trained in depending on their own
efforts, have died seeking the mine.
Water holes are few, and miles
apart.
Ruth, an elderly city man. took a
tremendous risk, but he was confi
dent that the data and government
maps over which he had spent years
would lead him to the famous mine.
Mrs. Ruth was advised by tele
graph of her husband's disappear
ance. She wired back an offer of
SIOO to the finder of Ruth or his
body.

Angeles County produced 4.32

declaration of the government, in
which it expresses confidence, so
that it may continue the policy of
mutual aid with absolute respect for
the rights and interests of France.”
Rv RALPH HEIXZEN
United Press Staff Correspondent
PARIS. June 26. (U.R) —'The Am
erican position on the Hoover war
debt plan, the complete fulfillment
of which has been endangered by
French reservations, was presented
to the French government by Sec
retary of the Treasury Andrew W.
Mellon at a luncheon with Premier
Pierre Laval and members of iris
cabinet.
Before the luncheon, Mellon met
Pierre Etienne Flandin, French fi
nance minister, and exposed the
principles inspiring President Hoo
ver's proposition. He stressed the |
point that the sacrifices offered by
the United States far surpass those
asked of any other power.
The French note replying to the
Hoover proposal was made public
this afternoon. Walter E. Edge, the !
United States ambassador, handed ;
to Premier Laval the reply of Presi- 1
dent Hoover to the French note, j
which said:
""The American government ap- j
predates the cordiality of the 1
French government's response io .
the President's proposition and
hopes France will take advantage
of the presence of the secretary of
the treasury in Paris to discuss with |
Ambassador Edge and Secretary |
Mellon the various problems arising i
out of President Hoover's original I
proposition and the French answer. J
Mr. Edge and Mr. Mellon are fully I
advised regarding the views of my j
government.”
The luncheon was gay and amia- '
ble, with a cordial discussion of the
subject but no detailed conversa -
tions. No date has been set for
further conversations by Mellon,
but it probably will be tomorrow.
WASHINGTON, June 26. (U.R) —
Secretary of State Stimson said to
j day that accomplishment of the
full measure of relief sought by
President Hoover's debtors' holiday
program would require modification
of the French suggestions for mak
ing it effective.
Stimson’s statement was made
public by the state department ac
companied by a translation of the
French reply to Mr. Horner's pro
posal. The nature of the French
answer had been discounted in
Washington in advance and was
not considered fundamentally to
have altered the general air of op
timism among informed officials
After discussing the French atti
tude yesterday with Paul Claudel,
French ambassador, Stimson said
hr had obtained encouragement
and today he said the evidence of
cooperation in the French note
""gives every hope of success.""
Stimson explained further nego
tiation would be necessary and
that Secretary of Treasury Mellon
and Walter E. Edge. American am
bassador. were engaged today in
discussions with French officials in
Paris.
""There are suggestions in the
method proposed by the French
government."" Stimson said, “which
do not accomplish the full measure
of relief to debtor nations corres
ponding to the President's plan
must, therefore, be the subject of
further discussion that will bring
the full measure of accord of which
the fine evidence of cooperation in
the French note gives every hope of
success.""

GRAND JURY TO
MAKE PROBE OF
RICHFIELD CASE
LOS ANGELES, June 26. (U.R)—A
i letter, said to contain amplified ci
tations of alleged law violations on
the part of former officials of the
Richfield Oil company, will be
placed before the grand jury short
' ly, it was announced today by Chief
| Deputy District Attorney Robert P.
i Stewart.
The letter, Stewart said, was writ

Stewart declined to make public
the nature of the letter's contents
' after holding a conference with
Deputy Ray Brockman.
The following statement was is
i sued by Stewart after conferring
| with Ray Brockman, prosecuting
deputy corporation commissioner.
""Referring to the supplemental
| letter of Corporation Commissioner
Haight received by the district at
torney’s office on last June 24. it
was said by Deputy Stewart that it
was manifestly Impossible to give
the details of the four-page letter
which may be of an evidential char
acter.
""He further stated that the sub
ject matter of the letter only re
ferred to the Richfield Oil company
of California, a corporation, and
acts done on its behalf.
""The magnitude of the data sub
mitted by the corporation commis
sioner and his associates In connec
tion with the Richfield Oil company
and its subsidiaries is requiring a
great amount of work by members
of this office in the preliminary in
vestigation.
“As soon as the evidential matter
has been compiled and the legal
course of action determined upon,
the matter will be submitted to the
grand jury.
""Until that time it will be im
possible, Or course, to give any of
the details of the evidence as this

Young Bandit
Loses His Nerve
LOS ANGELES. June 26. (U.R)—
A young bandit started to hold up
the First National Bank of Hynes,
a suburb, today and fled as Miss
Grace Nays, cashier, turned toward
the cash box to get him some
money.
The youth, armed with a revolver,
informed Miss Nays that “this is a
stickup, but I hate to do it.”
Apparently a novice, the youth
lost his nerve and fled.

FIGURES SHOW
NORTH ENDERS 1
TOO OPTIMISTIC
Interested in the assertions made
in a letter to the county board of
supervisors from the Calipatria
Chamber of* Commerce, and re
ceived at the court house this morn
ing. and in the assertions made by
delegations which last Monday
night appeared before the supervi
sors. a Press reporter today made
a check of official county figures on
file in the coi/rt house and dis
covered the following facts:
Imperial county has a total popu
lation of 48,594 persons.
Supervisorial district No. 4. the
north end district, lias a popula
tion of 14,244 persons.
This is 29 * a per cent of the total
population of the county.
North-end delegations asserted
their district contained 40 per cent
of the total population of Imperial
county.
Supervisorial district No. 2, which
includes El Centro, has a population
of 16,402, or 2158 more than the
north end district.
Districl No. 3 has the least popu
lation, with only 3955.
Imperial county’s total assessed
tax valuation is $46,257,231.
The assessed valuation of Road
District No. 4, which is the same as
Supervisorial District No. 4. is $lB,-
067,146.
This is 39.05 per cent of the total
assessed valuation of the county.
The north enn delegations, and
the Calipatria Chamber of Com
merce stated the north end district
contains more than 42 per cent of
the county's assessed property val
uation.
The assertion of the northenders
that their section contains the
greatest rood milage in the county
was found to be correct.
Assertions that they have 40 per
cent of the total county population,
pay 42 per cent of the taxes, and
have 900 miles of roads were mad?
by delegates from the north-end,
who appeared before the board of
supervisors in an effort to secure
county redistricting on such a plan
that the north-end will have two
supervisors instead of one.

THIRTY-SECOND YEAR
SENATOR
JOHNSON
DESERTS
Will Actively Aid Cam
paign For Election Of
’ Roosevelt.
TO SPEAK” FRIDAY
Democrats Pleased With
Decision Of Noted Po
litical Leader.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 22. (U.R)
—United States Senator Hiram W.
Johnson, powerful progressive Re
publican, will actively campaign
for Franklin D. Roosevelt, Demo
cratic candidate for President. He
Will speak on behalf of Governor
Roosevelt at a mass meeting here
next Friday night, it was an
nounced today.
In bolting his party, the senator
took with him powerful labor lead
ers and the northern and central
California lieutenants who have
aided in making him a dominant
figure in California politics for a
quarter of a century.
“Senator Johnson will speak in
support of the candidacy of Gov
ernor Roosevelt at a mass meet
ing to be held under the auspices
of the progressive Republican
Roosevelt League of California in
Dreamland auditorium, October 28,”
said a statement issued by Fred
V. Williams, representing the
Democratic party.
That announcement was the
only formal notice that Johnson
had bolted his party to support the
Democratic nominee.
“We’re all organized and ready
to go,"" commented Paul Scharren
berg, secretary of the state feder
ation of labor and a vice president
of the organization, in confirming
the announcement.
The same supporters who elect
ed Johnson governor 21 years ago,
sent him to the senate and follow
ed him into Theodore Roosevelt’s
“Bull Moose” party in 1912 today
joined him in a militant organiza
tion seeking to defeat President
Hoover in his home state.
The action, political observers
believed, created a new campaign
issue—progressivism opposed to
regularity. It plunged into a strug
gle for control of California's 22
electoral votes by two heroes of
California Republicanism, Presi
dent Hoover and one of his most
determined enemies, Senator John
son.
Both have strong personal fol
lowings. Both have powerful ma
chines.
Organize In State
Jubilant Democratic leaders lost
no time today in claiming Senator
Johnson’s active endorsement of
Roosevelt definitely assured this
state being in the Democratic col
umn at the November 8 election.
The organization, with leaders in
every northern California county,
that the senator today presented
the Democrats, will be sufficient
to break up the vast Republican
majority in California, Bourbon
leaders claimed. Added to phenom
enal Democratic gains in registra
tion, they said, the progressive Re
publican vote should assure a safe
malority for Roosevelt.
Republicans profess to be un
worried. Johnson’s antagonism to
the President, they declared, has
been evident for four years. His
open opposition, they declaraed,
will not have a much greater effect
than his passive hostility.
Today’s announcement marked
the senator's first excursion into
Democratic ranks in his long car
eer. .
In 1912, when he bolted his par
ly, it was to join the Independent-
Republican “Bull Moose’’ organi
zation as vice presidential candi
date. In 1916 he was credited with

CLEAR THINKING
URGED BY SWING
IN BRAWLEY TALK
Causes and effects of prevailing
economic conditions formed the
subject of a lengthy address by
Phil Swing last night before the
Associated Chambers of Commerce
meeting at Brawley.
A large crowd, drawing repre
sentatives from all sections of Im
perial Valley, listened to Swing as
he explained reasons for the pres
ent economic crisis.
The attack on the government
because of the depression should
be directed not so much at gov
ernmental agencies, Swing de
clared, as at large corporations.
Only by clear, logical thinking
will the country be brought out of
the depression and into an era of
prosperity, Swing asserted.
After listening to Swing’s talk,
members of the Associated Cham
bers of Commerce took up business
of the organization, going on rec
ord as favoring a mail contract for
airlines at present operating a
daily schedule into Imperial Valley
from Los Angeles.
Another stand taken by the As
sociated Chambers of Commerce
was in favor of a proposed high
way intersecting the El Centro-San
Diego highway and leading to La
guna Junction.

PRISON GUARDS
SUBDUE RIOT IN
MANHATTAN JAIL
Elaborate Precautions By
Police To Prevent Es
capes By Prisoners.
By SANDOR S. KLEIN
United Press Staff Correspondent
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.—(U.R)-
Police emergency squads summoned
from the heart of Manhattan laid
siege lines along the crowded banks
of East River today while guards
clashed with rioting prisoners in
city penal institutions on Welfare
Island.
Cinp convict, George Hoeshoe,
was stabbed and killed. A short
time after the outbreak a police
sergeant from the island passed
through the guard lines and re
ported:
“It's all over now.""
The rioting started when a group
of convicts, visiting the warden’s
office to present grievances, began
fighting among themselves, police
said. There had been bad blood
between Italian and Irish fac
tions, it was said.
Within a few minutes, police em
ergency squads and police automo
biles were speeding to the river
banks from mid-town Brooklyn
and other districts on the Man
hattan and Long Island sides of the
river oppose ine island.
They lined the river banks in the
shadow of towering apartment
buldings the most fashionable
district in Manhattan —hardly more
than a stone's throw from the pen
al island. Police were armed with
tear bombs, shot guns and ma
chine guns.
An amphibian plane flew over
head and fireboats and police boats
sputtering wildly as they sped
down the river, circled close to the
island’s edge.
While police on land, sea and
in the air guarded against possible
attempts to escape, the guards on
the island were clubbing the un
ruly convicts into submission. The
fighting lasted about 45 minutes.
The disturbance appeared to have
been confined to the southern end
of the island.
THREE CONVICTS
WOUNDED DURING
PRISON RIOTING
KINGSTON, Oct. 22. (U.R)-
Three prisoners we're wounded in
rioting within Kingston peniten
tiary according to an official state
ment and explanation issued by
Brigadier General D. M. Ormond,
government inspector of prisons.
“One man,” he said, “has a
wound in the shoulder from ar ri
cochet buckshot; one man in the
isolated prison is wounded in the
leg and another is wounded in the
shoulder. No wounds are serious.”
This was the first official word
that any of the prisoners involved
in two riots Monday and Thursday
night and Friday morning, have
been injured.
General Ormond’s statement
said: “All is quiet. A complete
check shows that the penitentiary
count is correct. The damage is less
than expected.”
It had been reported that a star
vation siege would be initiated by
troops and guards to force the sur
render of the mutinous convicts,
but every evidence today was that
all involved in the revolt had been
placed in cells.

GUARANTEE COACHELLA NO
RIGHTS TO RIVER WATER
Definite statement that Imperial
I Irrigation district can’make no as
| surance of water for Coachella
i Valley as a basis of a separate
contract with the government and
that Coachella Valley has no water
rights from the Colorado river, was
contained in a telegram sent today
to John H. Edwards, acting secre
tary of interior.
The telegram was sent by Im
perial board of directors in re
sponse to a telegram asking what
water Imperial district would allot
Coachella in the event of a sep
arate contract.
In explanation of the statement
that no assurance of water could
be made Coachella Valley, the tele
gram said there are approximate
ly 850,000 acres in Imperial county
for which the district has rights
to be satisfied from priority No. 3.
Coachella Valley, the telegram
continued, has no water rights
from the Colorado river and there
fore, it is obvious the district
rights must be first satisfied be
fore Coachella can receive water.
When district rights are satisfied,
the quantity left for Coachella to
deal with as her own must of ne
cessity be indefinite and uncertain.
This would be true even if the
district should limit itself to a
definite quantity of water out of
priority three, according to the
telegram, as the amount remain
ing would be dependent upon the
LARGE NUMBER OF HUNTERS IN
MOUNTAINS TRAPPED BY SNOW
SHERIDAN, Wyo., Oct. 22.—(U.R)
—Trapped by the vicious onslaught
of a fall blizzard, 53 hunters were
snowbount somewhere in the rug
ged Tongue river country of the
Big Horn mountains today.
Since last Sunday afternoon when
the blizzard broke they have been
in the hills, without shelter, and
some of them possibly without food.
Weary forest rangers, fire guards
and volunteers their faces grey with
exhaustion, and eyes red from fac
ing the glare of sun on snow,
tramped trails into the white wild
erness, in an attempt to rescue the
hunters.
Fear was felt for the lives of at
least three of the snowbound men.
Fred E. Demmel of Sheridan, a 21-
year-old youth named Yoakum, of

RESTORATION OF
PROSPERITY IS
ROOSEVELT AIM
By RAYMOND CLAPPER
United Press Staff Correspondent
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 22.
Restoration of prosperity to the
whole people is the great issue of
this campaign, Governor Roosevelt
told an audience from the rear
platform of his special train just
before reaching Louisville today.
The train paused at New Al
bany, Ind., just across the river
from here.
“The great issue in this cam
paign is to bring prosperity back
to the American people as a
whole,” he said.
The governor was obliged to
collect his thoughts rapidly for
this back platform appearance be
cause he was just getting dressed
when the train reached New Al
bany.
The Democratic candidate swung
on through Kentucky and Tennes
see today with pledges left behind
in addresses at Springfield, 111.,
and St. Louis, Mo., to give relief
to American farmers and protect
the nation’s security olders.
He combined the outline .of his
policy with scathing ridicule of
what. he termed efforts by the Re
publican leadership including Pres
ident Hoover and Ex-President
Coolidge to frighten the nation
with a charge panic would follow
a Democratic victory.
He termed the attempt a worn
out stage trick patented by Mark
Hanna.
Governor Roosevelt scheduled
his first major stop today at
Louisville, Ky., where an address
was planned shortly before noon.
Other brief appearances were
scheduled including ones at Le
banon and Corbin, Ky. He was to
reach Knoxville, Tcnn., at 9 p. m.
It could be stated today without
question that Governor Roosevelt
is firmly convinced his election is
certain. What he desires now is
that his party workers do not be
come overconfident.
State Democrats
Show Huge Gain
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 22.—(U.R)< —
With the Democratic registration
increasing nearly twice as fast as
that'of the Republican party sine?
the August primary, California has
a record qualified electorate of 2,-
889,013 voters, a compilation of re
gistration figures by Secretary of
State Frank C. Jordan revealed to
day.
In a nominally Republican state,
the Democrats were pushing this
leadership hard with a total of
1,161,482 voters as compared to the
Republican registration of 1,565,264.
During this same period the So
cialists gained more than 1,000
voters for a total of 15,837. Other
party totals included Prohibition,
10,805; Liberty, 2,318; declined to
state 132,571, and miscellaneous 736.

uses under priorities one and two.
In conclusion the telegram said
the district cannot limit Itself to
acre feet without including for the
district substantially all of the
water that is reasonably known to
be available under priority three.
Denial of reports in Coachella
Valley that Imperial Irrigation
district directors and officials in
stigated questions asked the board
of directors of the Coachella Wat
er association in a recent com
munication from the interior de
partment, was contained in a tel
egram sent Coachella residents by
John H. Edwards, acting secretary
of interior.
A copy of the telegram was sent
district headquarters here and was
read at a board meeting this morn
ing.
The telegram explained that the
questions were prepared by mem
bers of the department of interior
staff and submitted to the secre
tary and he in turn sent thqjn to
leaders of he opposition for in
clusion. The secretary asked the
opposition to forward answers to
the questions to him at once.
Questions asked by the interior
department concerned Coachella’s
hope of a separate contract with
the government in place of being
included in the Imperial district
under the All-American CanaT
contract.
rated from their hunting parties
when the fierce force of the unex
pected blizzard broke. Without
food and without shelter, they have
been in that bitter cold country ev
er since.
A posse of 50 volunteer searched
the mountains for them today.
Nearly 1000 hunters were in the
Big Horns when the storm broke.
Some seven hundred of the hunters
managed to fight their way
through rapidly piling drifts Sun
day evening, and reached civili
zation.
Three hundred or more were
trapped. Yesterday 250 of them
were rescued, many suffering from
exposure and hunger, after the for
estry service had beaten trails into
the mountains.
The men were found in litte
groups, huddled around fires. In
almost every case their food sup
plies had been depleted a day or
more. At least a score of the 250
were near collapse although none
was believed seriously injured by
prolonged exposure.
More than two feet of snow fell
on the level, during the storm,
which lasted from Sunday until
Wednesday. In places the drifts
were nearly 20 feet deep. At the
8500 foot altitude on the forbidding
sides of the Big Horns, where
most df the remaining hunters are
believed to be, the temperature has
dropped to within 10 degrees of
zero the last several nights. A biting
wind blows almost continuously.

First Carload Of
Grapefruit Moves
First freight car of valley grape
fruit went out yesterday according
to E. A. Harrigan, agricultural
commissioner, who states that ship
ments this year are lighter than
at the same time last year.
Growers and shippers agreed to
hold off shipments until October
10, so that the fruit would be more
mature and reach the color stan
dard of 50 per cent which the
growers voluntarily set, as well as
the 6-1 standard, six parts solu
bles solid to one of acid.
The heavy rainstorm occurring
near the tenth delayed - picking
and consequently shipping. A num
ber of truckloads of fruit have been
sent for the past 10 days, and some
1.c.1. shipments, but yesteiday
marked the first freight car.
Harrigan states that the quality
of this first fruit is fine but that
the crop generally is lighter than
last year. ,
YOUNGER INSULL
WILL RETURN TO
UNITED STATES
Will Not Al*emot Evasion
Of Arrest If Such Ac
tion Is Intended.
By HERBERT MOORE
United Press Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Oct. 22.—(U.R)—Sam
uel Insull, Jr., will return to the
United States even if Chicago au
thorities decide to arrest him, he
told the United Press today.
Insull professed to be a tourist,
chiefly interested in London’s pen
ny-slot museums. He insisted he
would return to the United States
in November to resume his job as
chairman of three Chicago operat
ing companies.
In response to a direct inquiry
by the United Press as to whether
he would return even if Chicago
authorities decided to arrest him
for complicity in the collapse of the
Insull industrial empire, he re
plied :
“I probably—yes, I will.”
Insull refused a formal state
ment. He declined to comment on
a question regarding charges
against himself, his father, or Mar
tin Insull.
Insull insisted he was here mere
ly on a personal visit. It was re
ported however, that he hoped to
sound out the British government
on the possibility of Samuel In
sull, Sr., requesting political asy
lum on British soil, perhaps in Cy
prus. The elder Insull is in Greece,
but his Greek visa will expire in a
short time.
Samuel, Jr., admitted he might
make a quick trip to Athens before
going home. He admitted he would
consult London barristers associat
ed with Greek attorneys in hand
ling his father’s affairs.
Insull had not decided if he
would try to vote by mail.
“I feel like a carp taken from
a muddy river and put in a gold
fish bowl, under a spotlight,’” in
sul said of the publicity he nas

CHAMBER SAYS
POPULATION AT
LEAST 10,000
Although it is difficult to reach
an accurate estimate of the census
of a city without personal enumer
ation such as is made at the time
of the decennial census, the El
Centro Chamber of Commerce staff
has compiled figures which prove
conclusively that the population of
El Centro at the present time is at
least 10,000.
Figures from the great register
of the county show that El Cen
tro has 4,342 registered voters at
the present time, while the 1930
census gave El Centro a foreign
adult population of 600. This
makes a total of 4,942 voters and
adult foreigners. There are 1,482
pupils in the city grammar schools,
636 in high school and 145 in jun
ior college; making a total of
school attendance of 2,363. Based
on the average size of the combined
first grades of the city, there are
1,560 children in the city of pre
school age. This gives a total pop
ulation of children, foreigners and
voters of 8,865, leaving a margin of
1,135 persons in the city who are
not in school, not foreign and not
registered voters, which would seem
to be a conservative estimate as
compared with statistics available
in other cities.
Before compiling these figures
the chamber staff ascertained that
the population of a city is gener
ally estimated at three times the
number of registered voters. This
would give El Centro a popolation
of 13,026. However, the chamber,
desiring to use these figures in pub
licity work, determined on a more
accurate method of ascertaining
the population of El Centro, with
the result, as shown above, that the
actual population can be accepted
as 10,000 persons.
This is a gain of about 1,500 per
sons in the past two and a half
years, when the official census gave
El Centro a population of 8,427, or
17 V 4 per cent increase. While only
17 per cent of the persons living
in Imperial County reside in El
Centro, 22 1-3 per cent of the reg
stered voters of the county live
in this city. This is due to the low
percentage of foreign population in
E Centro, which has fewer foreign
ers than any other city in the
county. According to the 1930 cen
sus, El Centro has but 14 1-3 per
cent foreign population, while the
entire county has a foreign popu
lation of 42 2-3 per cent and other
cities vary from 27 to 53 per cent
foreign population.
Anti-Tuberculosis
Group Plans For
Valley Campaign
Projects for this year’s work on
the part of the Imperial County
Tuberculosis society as decided up
on at last night’s meeting held in
the Barbara Worth hotel, are the
making possible of more available
diagnostic facilities and a program
aiding the underweight and un
derprivileged child.
More available diagnostic facili
ties will be brought about by
means of occasional diagnostic
tubercular chest conferences as di
rected by the county medical as
sociation and the county health
department.
The program for the underweight
and under-nourished child will be
carried on in cooperation with the
school nurse and will consist in
supplying rest cots and nourishment
for these children.
In addition to planning this pro
gram which will be sponsored by
the county association, the meet
ing last night, attended by rep
resentatives from the entire coun
ty, was concerned with details of
the 1932 Christmas seal campaign
proceeds from which will be used
!lo finance the above mentioned
| projects.

HOOVER DEFENDS
PARTY’S POLICY
ON TARIFF RATE
President Speaks To Big
Crowd At Charleston
Enroute To Detroit.
By THOMAS L. STOKES
United Press Staff Correspondent
CHARLESTON, W. Va„ Oct. 22. j
(U.R)’ —President Hoover announced
here today that ne had ‘‘asked the
tariff commission to reinvestigate
the whole rates of many commodi
ties to see whether the tariff is
giving the protection provided in
the law.”
The President returned to his
sturdy support of the Republican
party’s protective tariff policy. He
reiterated his attack on the Demo
cratic policy of lowering the tar
iffs and told an audience packed
in a stadium near the railway sta
tion that “The Democratic party
promises to destroy the effective
ness of the tariff commission.”
He declared a recent survey of
the standard of living in the Uni
ted States and abroad showed Am
erican workers to be far better off
than any of their foreign brethern.
“I found,” Mr. Hoover said, ""that
in the highest paid countries, in
stead of being able to purchase
one-half as much bread and butter
as an American workman, they
could purchase only one-third as
much and in the countries of low
est standards of living, instead of
purchasing one-third as much they
could only purchase one-eighth as
much.
“In the face of this, the Demo
cratic party promises to reduce
your tariffs. In the face of this,
I have asked the tariff commission
to reinvestigate the whole rates on
many commodities to see whether
the tariff is giving the protection
provided in the law.”
The President was greeted by
West Virginia political leaders. He
went at once to a nearby stadium
and delivered his 20 minute talk.
It was the longest address on a
day of campaigning on his way to
speak in Detroit at Olympia hall
tonight.
He was up early working on his
speech for tonight. He arose short
ly after 6 a. m.
The President in his speech here
premised aid for the soft coal work
ers. “Some years ago,” he said, “I
suggested there should be come
measure of cooperation in the mar
keting of coal.”
FEDERAL AGENT
TAKES EVIDENCE
IN GIRL’S DEATH
Evidence against Ambrose Brown,
45-year-old Indian, in a projected
federal court murder trial should
he recover from self-inflicted in
juries, was being gathered today
by Edmund J. Qeehan, federal in
vestigator, after a coroner's jury of
Indians this’ afternoon named
Brown as the slayer of his 4-year
old daughter, Annabelle Brown.
Geehan arrived here from Los
Angeles last night, and this morn
ing left for the Ft. Yuma reserva
tion in company with District At
torney Elmer W. Heald, who pre
sided over the inquest, and Tom
Sharp, district attorney’s investi
gator.
While the white men were car
rying on their interviews with va
rious witnesses, Indian families
from every part of the reservation
had gathered at the funeral grounds
for cremation ceremonies this after
noon over the body of the girl.
The wailing voices of the Indians
could be heard even yesterday af
ternoon as they began the con
tinuous chant intended to keep evil
spirits away and help the girl’s
spirit on its way to the happy hunt
ing ground. The wailing will con
tinue until the body is cremated,
with appropriate ceremony.
It was a matter of wonder to
hospital attendants and others that
Brown, in spite of a seeming de
sire to die, held consciousness and
even seemed to improve in condi
tion under the ministrations of
physicians and nurses at the Ft.
Yuma hospital on Indian Hill.
A guard was still maintained to
day to prevent Brown from snatch
ing a rubber breathing tube from
his throat, which he slashed
Wednesday night after he cut his
daughter’s throat with an axe be
cause he feared the Indian agent
and members of the Cocopah tribe
would take the girl from him.
Thomas Returning
To Make Amends
REDONDO BEACH, Calif., Oct.
22. —'(U.R) —Elliott B. Thomas, young
(grammar school , superintendent
whose disappearance at first
aroused fears he had been kidnap
ped, was reported en route back
home today to ""make amends"" for
his asserted deception.
Deserting his Seattle fiancee on
the eve of their intended marriage,
Thomas left the Washington city
last night to return to his wife
here, Seattle police advised local
authorities. They said that the girl,
Sylvia Wilson, who knew him as
E. T. Sherwood, told them of his
departure.
The superintendent’s young wife
harbored no ill feelings against her
husband, she advised local deputies.
“I am thinkful for his sake that
the marriage did not take place,""
she said.
Authorities said they would make
no attempts to prosecute him.

IGNORED
Civil Service Discarded
In Selecting Right Of
Way Officials.
FRIENDS GET JOBS
Eligible Lists Held Up
At Alleged Request Of
Garrison.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 22.—(U.R/V-
Civil service regulations controll
ing the appointment of state high
way right of ways agents were vir
tually scrapped at the beginning
of the Roipjh administration, a
check of public works department
records revealed today.
As a result attention here again
was centered on the department
of public works after other depart
ments had been drawn into the
controversy wfilch has raged for
two weeks following the dis
missal or Col. Walter E. Garrison
and James I. Herz, former direc
tor and deputy director of public
works.
The right of way division was
placed under civil service under
Governor Young’s administration,
but the first examination was held
on December 27, 1930, shortly be
fore Rolph was inaugurated, state
records reveal.
A few days later, Rolland A.
Vandegrift, state director of fin
ance, ordered preparation of the
eligible list held up.
“I stopped all examinations be
cause it appeared there was no
proper advertising to open the
tests to the public. Only 28 per
sons took the right of way agent
examination, and these men were
then employed,' Vandegrift said.
In explaining why. a new exam
ination was not called, Vandegrift
said it was held up on the re
quest of Col. Garrison and after
objections from Herz.
In connection with this protest,
Herz is reported as having said the
30 available Jobs were “promised
to friends.”
By January 15, 1931, state rec
ords show that 27 of the 34 right
of-way agents were replaced by
political appointees under “tempor
ary authorization.”
A few days later, minutes of the
civil service commission show, Col.
Garrison asked that “the contem
plated oral examinations for right
of way agents be indefinitely post
poned because I am considering
several changes in the duties in
volved.”
In connection with this develop
ment political observers pointed
out that the right of way division
was involved in the only case of
established collusion in the barrage
of charges fired during the ad
ministration row. One of the right
of way agent, George W. Pulich,
of Stockton, recently pleaded guil
ty to charges involving bribery.
FRESNO, Calif., Oct. 22. <U.R) —
Evidence on which the California
State Grange based charges of “ir
regularities in at least two depart
ments of the state administration”
and demanded a legislative investi
gation, will be turned over to the
investigating group if one is named
This was disclosed by grange of
ficials today at the close of their
annual convention.
A resolution, asking that the state
senate investigate the state admin
istration. was passed by the con
vention last night, without debate
and by unanimous vote, according
to officials of the order.
Considerable evidence concerning
alleged irregularities in the state
administration has been amassed by
grange investigators, M. W. New
man, secretary, said.

HARMONY NEEDED HERE
City officials of tho valley have
formed tho Imperial County League of
Municipalities, the stated object of which
is to work together to advance tho cause
of local projects principally through
cooperation and coordination with the
California League of Municipalities.
It should be the hope of all, that the
operation of the league will be another
means of bringing out harmony between
the various municipalities in the valley,
and doubtless it will have that effect.
Men who band together in an undertak
ing such as the league, open the way for
a common ground on which to solve and
settle disagreements which may arise.
The Associated Chambers of Com
merce has done much to promote valley
wide harmony. However, its very nature
prevents it from taking an active part in
political matters —a fact which has en
abled it to be of great service to the en
tire valley.
It may be that the League also is pre
vented from discussing or acting upon
political matters. Even should this be
true, it should not prevent the various
city officials from discussing, informally,
matters of a political nature.
Whatever rules there may be which
will limit the activities of the League, it
should be an excellent factor in foster
ing that which Imperial Valley needs
more than anything else—harmony.
We are assured our two biggest proj
ects —Boulder dam and the All-Ameri
can canal. The fight for them has split
the valley into factions for over two de
cades. Now that they are to be realized,
the strife of the past should be forgot
ten and all sections of the valley and the
individuals composing them, should be
able to work together for the good of the
entire community.
This does not mean that wholesome
inter-sectional rivalry should be dropped. |
Far from it. But inter-sectional preju- I
dices and misunderstandings should not !
be permitted to keep the valley in per
petual turmoil.
After all, there is no difference in any j
of us. We may live in El Centro, Braw- I
ley, Heber, Niland or Mesquite Lake, but
we are all valley residents. What bene- j
fits one community is certain, in the long '
run. to benefit all of us.
We can afford now to give a little more
time and effort to supporting such or
ganizations as the Associated Chambers
of Commerce, the League of Municipali
ties, service clubs, individual chambers
of commerce and any activity which has
the good of the valley as its’objective.
We.should continue to take our politics
seriously, but once the issue has been de
cided, all of us should be good sports

William C. Bullitt, to whom Lloyd
George once referred as ‘‘just a
schoolboy” probably will play an
important part in the Russian rec

Bullitt, the well dressed hand
some special assistant to Secretary
of State Hull was in on the birth
of the Soviet republic. He was one
of the first skilled diplomats to
come out of that country during
the Kerensky upset and predict
that the Bolshevik regrime was
there to stay. Few would believe
him at the time.
Bullitt was in Paris with Presi

when dispatched to Russia with
Lincoln Steffens to bring back the
real “low down” on what was hap
pening in northern Europe.

DRINK ALL YOU WANT
There has been more concern ex
pressed by people outside Imperial Val
ley over the “danger” of drinking Colo
rado river water than there ever has been
by those who have used it for years,
nevertheless the report of the state board
of health, praising El Centro city water,
should relieve whatever doubt might
exist locally in this connection.
The report states that out of 187 sam
ples of El Centro water examined by the
state board of health, none was found to
show any contamination.
Objections to drinking Colorado river
water have been made chiefly by oppo
nents of the Metropolitan Water District
aqueduct, who seized upon this unfair
method of fighting the project. It is
purely a political subterfuge and is with
out any basis of truth.
The objectors asserted that Colorado
river water produces “mottled teeth,”
due to chemical substances in the water.
All instances where such a condition ex
isted have been traced back to some cause
other than Colorado river water. Cer
tainly if the contention were true evi
dence of “mottled teeth” should be fre
quent in the valley where the water has
been used for drinking purposes for over
30 years.
El Centro has every reason to be proud
of its water supply and residents should
have no hesitancy in using it freely. A
comparison with the water of any other
small community in the country will not
place the local product in a bad light.

1 UNCLE WIGGILY’S BLUE COAT
|
“Who is this coming up the front
steps?'? asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzz.v one day as she looked out oi
the window cf Uncle Wiggily's hol
low stump bungalow.
“It's some one wearing a blue
| coat.” said Mrs. Longears, who was
helping the muskrat lady house
keeper clear away the breakfast
! dishes.
“Let me take a look!'' suggested
Uncle Wiggily. who was twinkling
his pink nose in front of the mirror
to make sure it was bright enough.
And when he had looked, Mr. Long
ears said:
“Why, that’s my fat friend, Mr
Twistytail.""
“A pig with a blue coat!” exclaim
ed Nurse Jane.
“What a jolly idea!” said Mrs.
Lonegars.
“You should have seen his red
hat! ’ chuckled Uncle Wiggily. “He
had that on the other day and did
he look sporty? Oh, boy! Oh, boy!""
“His blue coat is very stylish, I
think,” said Nurse Jane.
“Indeed it is!’ agreed Uncle Wig
gily as Mr. Twistytail rang the bell.
“I wish I had one like it.”
“Hello, Wiggy’’ greeted the fat
pig gentleman as Uncle Wiggily op
ened the bungalow door. “Don’t you
want to come for a walk with mo
and my blue coat?”
“I’d love to,” said the rabbit gen
tleman, “but I ought to have a blue
coat to match yours.”
“Never mind,” grunted the pig.
“Your black coat looks very well
with your red trousers. Anyhow you
can’t get a blue coat.”
j “Why not?” asked Mr. Longears.
| “Because I just bought the last
one in the store. There isn't another
blue ccat left in Woodland. I'm sor
j ry. If I had known you wanted a
: blue ccat I wouldn’t have bought
this one. You might have had it for
yourself.”
“It wouldn't have done me any
good,” said Uncle Wiggily with a
laugh. “A coat that would fit you,
1 Twisty, would be too big for me, It
is just as well, I’ll wear my black
one.”
“And we’ll go adventuring,” grunt
ed the fat pig.
He and Uncle Wiggily set out to
gether, the pig looking very line in
his blue coat; but Uncle Wiggily
also looked very well in his black
coat and red trousers. Still, and with
all, as he saw the fine blue coat on
the back of his pig lriend, Uncle
Wiggily couldn't help wishing he
had one like it.
At last the pig and tfie rabbit
reached the woods where there were
many kinds of adventures, some
funny and some not so funny, un
oie Wiggily dearly loved adventures.
BED-TIME STORIES

THE VERY FIRST LADY
mured Mr. Longears as he looked at
the trees and bushes.
“I don't know,” grunted the pig
gentleman. “But this I do know: I
am going to lie down and take a
rest and maybe a sleep.”
“Are you going to lie down in
your nice blue coat?” asked Uncle
Wiggily. “If you do you will crinkle
it all up.""
“I’ll take oft my coat when I lie
down to rest,’’ said the pig, and this
he did, carefully folding the coat on
a leg beside which he stretched out
in some clean, dried leaves to sleep.
“Well, I'm going to look for an ad
venture,” said Uncle Wiggily. “111
come back to you after a while.
Twisty.” Mr. Twistytail did not an
swer. He was fast asleep.
Uncle Wiggily hepped along and
alcnger and, after a while, he also
felt sleepy. He found a soft bed of
leaves and, as Mr. Twistytail had
done, Mr. Longears took off his
black coat and folded it on a log so
he would not crease it. Then the
rabbit slept.
And as he slept along flew many
Blue Jay birds. They had heard
what Uncle Wiggily said about
wanting a blue coat, but not being
able to get it, so one Blue Jay said:
“We’ll make Uncle Wiggily a blue
coat?”
“How can we?” asked another
bird.
""With the many blue feathers
that drop out of our wings and
tails,” was the answer. “We’ll pick
these fallen feathers up off tho
ground and we’ll get the Tailor Bird
to sew them into a blue coat for
Uncle Wiggily. Quick! We'll make
him a blue coat before he awak
ens.”
As fast as roller skates, the Blue
Jays gathered up loose feathers.
The Tailor Bird sewed them into
the coat and when the rabbit awak
ened he saw it lying beside his black
one.
“Why, the fairies must have heard
my wish!” laughed Mr. Lohgears.
But when he looked at the coat
he knew the Blue Jays had made it
for him and he thanked them most
kindly. Then he wore his blue coat
heme.
And if the canary bird will make
a yellow coat for the black cat to
wear on its birthday, I’ll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily s Hallow
een party.

NEW YORK. July 29. <U.R) A
whirl in American Telephone &
Telegraph company capital stock
carried it to a new’ 1935 high late
today and accelerated a stock mar
ket rise that had been led respect
ively by railroad .steel and motor
shares.
The Dow-Jones industrial aver
age rose to a new high since 1931.
while the utility average made a
new high for the year. Tire rail
road average had its best gain
since early February and was car
ried to within two points of the
year’s high
Telephones spurt brought the
price to 131%, up 2% points from
Saturday and up 33 points from
the low for the year. Other com
munications advanced at a slower
pace. There was nothing in the
news to account for the sudden in
terest in the issue which of late
has been relatively quiet and
steady.
The entire group went into new
high territory when the American
Iron & Steel Institute announced
operations for the industry at 44
per cent of capacity, the highest
since April 22. United States Steel
common crossed 43 for the first
time since 1934. while the preferred
passed the 100-mark. Each gained
more than a point. Republic Is
sues. Bethlehem. Youngstown Sheet
& Tube, and National Steel made
new tops for the year or longer.
Chrysler. General Motors and
Studebaker made new highs for the
year. Motor equipments gained.
Aviation and shipbuilding stocks
strengthened, helped by word the
navy was ready to begin expan
sion and by publication of Great
Britain's huge navy building oper
ations.
Most encouragement for traders
was derived from the spurt in rail
road shares. Heavy buying carne
into New York Central, Pennsyl
vania. Atchison, and Southern Pa
cific, which advanced.
Investment buying continued to
make up the bulk of business on
the market.
Utilities made gains ranging to
2 points following substantial ad
vances Saturday.
Farm equipment issues made
new highs on gains ol tractions to
a point. About the only weak
spots were silvers and a few isolat
ed issues.
Volume approximated 1.750.000
shares, the largest total since May
28 when 2,307,870 shares were ex
changed.
Dow Jones preliminary closing
averages showed industrial 126-57
up 1.30. railroad 3529 up 0.97, util
ity 23.28 up 0.33.

SHARP REPLY
GIVEN ROME
BY EMPEROR
(Continued from Page One)
.grave by news from Addis Ababa
today that Emperor Haile Selassie,
in a note to Italy, said bluntly that
j he would not accede to Italian de-
I mands to limit the scope of discus
sion bat would insist that the
(league act.
There was apparent all over
Europe a rapidly increasing tensity.
Nations and groups of nations were
consulting through diplomatic
channels, each believing that in the
dispute between the 20Hi Century
Fascist corporative state and the old
kingdom of the Queen of Sheba its
1 own most vital interests were con
| cemed.
Future relations between the
I blacks of the African colonies and
i the European colonial powers, the
I chance of a small nation to obtain
effective help under the League of
Nations mandate against a big
nation, the rise of Nazi Germany,
the thought that Wednesday might
mark the turning point toward a
break-up of the league or its
emergence after 15 years of life
into a real power for peace, were
involved.
Al! Nations Alarmed
Concern which at first was felt
only among the great powers has
spread throughout southeastern
i Europe. The small nations there,
j who will be in any great war, were
I increasingly fearful that the Italian
' Ethiopian dispute might destroy
I the league as a peace agency. To
■ them the league is not an instru-
■ ment of diplomatic exchange but
I what it purported to be on its
formation a league to enforce
peace, and to protect them against
nations more powerful.
They fear that if the League ot j
Nations tries to sidestep the crisis j
by “legalizing” a war in Ethiopia to '
please Italy, the destruction will be
, completed which was threatened
1 when the league failed to keep
Japan from seizing Chinese Man
: churia.
United Press dispatches from!
Berlin report that German political;
quarters believe any effort to solve ■
the Italian-Ethiopian dispute will
be futile, and that the league’s dis
. integration is imminent. Germany
j feels, the dispatches said, that her
n position will be strengthened
ii. he league fails. There is no ef
lfort to conceal satisfaction at the
i league’s dilemma. It has never
I been a protector to Germans but
;an oppressor, being the enforcing
' agent of the Versailles treaty.
By THOMAS B. MORGAN
United Press Staff Correspondent
(Copyright, 1935. By United Press)
ROME. July 29.—Italians believ
ed today that war with Ethiopia
was near. They saw in League of
Nations efforts to solve the crisis
only a waste of words and in
creased confusion.
Stevedores w’ere loading 10 steam
ships with war materials at var- ■
ious ports. Additional thousands |
of soldiers were awaiting embark- j
ation.
War spirit was high, and the i
country was ready for a fight.
It was said frankly that diplo
matic negotiations with Great ,
Britain and France had achieved
exactly nothing after 10 days of
spirited effort.
There w’as no approach at all
between Britain and Italy, and the
limits of British and Italian con
cession remained far apart.
Ethiopia’s note of yesterday to
the League of Nations, maintaining
its position, caused no surprise, for j
no concession was expected. But
it was received as tending merely
to prolong diplomatic discussion ‘
between Italy and Ethiopia and
serving merely to involve greater
wordage and consequently addi
tional complication.
Pope Pius for the first time im- •
piled hi s interest in pea ce j
yesterday. He referred to the dis
pute in addressing the congrega
tion of missions from his throne in I
the consistorial hall, in connection
with the beautification of Kiustinoj
de Jacobis, Italian missionary in
Ethiopia for many years till his'
death July 31, 1860.
“Dark clouds hover in the skies >
between Italy and Ethiopia,” said ;
the pontiff, “and their significance ■
can not be overlooked.”
ROME, July 29. (U.R)—The for
eign office declared today it was
without knowledge of reports print
ed by the London Times and New
York Times that 40 Italians had
been killed in a border clash with
Ethifpians in the northwestern
frontier region bordering Italian
Eritrea.
Officials were somewhat skepti
cal that news of such a clash
would reach Addis Ababa before
Italian authorities heard of it.
According to the story as pub
lished abroad, dated Addis Ababa,
the Italian force, camped on the
Ethiopian side of the border, was
attacked at night by an Ethiopian
detachment. Forty Italians and
20 Ethiopians were killed, the story
said, and the Italians then retreat
ed by motor truck.

<U.R)—Charles (Mickey) Norman HI 1
celebrated his fourth birthday by
smoking four cigars.
The infant smoker, whose parents
have been the particular target of
anti-tobacco leagues throughout tne
country, smoked each cigar only
half way.
His mother explained that Mickey
has been smoking less the last two
years, and of late sometimes goes
two or three days without a cigar.
He has developed a liking for beer,
and prefers it to tobacco.

LOS ANGELES
NOT TO SLASH
RELIEF FUNDS
LOS ANGELES, July 29 (U.R)—The
county charities department will ex
haust its $7,000,000 annual budget
within six months rather than re
duce appropriations to families
living on direct relief, Superinten
dent Thomson said today.
“Rather than cut the present
average family budget of $34 a
month, to spread the $7,000,000 al
location over the entire year,""
Thomson said, “the department will
continue the prevailing budget
scale until the present funds are
exhausted.”
The county supervisors pruned
more than $19,000,000 from the de
partment’s budget request, lhe de
partment had asked for $39,000,000
an amount virtually equivalent to
the entire county budget last year.
The supervisors tentatively fixed the
county budget for the next fiscal
year at $42,735,000.

had hoped might be the case.
Costs of the work in the routing
of the canal were not considered
at this hearing, Hewes stated, but
the earthquake hazard was. This
was the main objection of the con
sultant board and engineers who
felt that the danger to the city of
Calexico was too great in case of
an earthquake should the canal be
routed underground through the
city because of the pressure in
volved. It was the opinion of the
engineers and consultants that in
case of a severe earthquake not
only the city of Calexico but also
neighboring farm lands would be 1
severely damaged by the breaking 1
of the canal were it to be routed
under the city and not to the I
north, above ground.
Mead expretsed himself as will
ing to make the canal an asset j
to the city of Calexico and not a
detriment by beautifying the canal
where it passes to the north of.
that city. Hewes said that the en- I
gineers and consulting board were i
unanimous in their decision on this |
question and set this decision down ;
in writing.
Wednesday night of this week,
R. B. Williams, chief engineer for
the All-American canal, will meet
with a group of Calexico citizens
in that city to discuss plans where
by the canal in the Calexico sector
might be beautified.
The valley representatives met
with Secretary Ickes again on Fri
day morning regarding the canal
routing question hoping to obtain
a complete rehearing of the matter
but Ickes upheld the findings of
the engineers and consultants and
no further action will now be taken
in the matter.
Hewes attended a meeting of
the district bondholders committee
in Los Angeles on Saturday morn
ing during which the secretary of
the committee was instructed to
draw up a letter and circulate it
among the committee members,
approving the action of the local
district board in its attempt to se
cure further refinancing of the dis
trict through RFC funds.
Hewes stated that he had run
into warm weather all the way
across the country and was glad to
be back in the valley again after
his trip.
Publisher Says
His Hotel Room
Was Ransacked
WASHINGTON, July 29. (U.R)—
Ransacking of his hotel room and
theft of evidence he had intended
to present to the senate lobby com
mittee was reported today by Carl
Estes, Texas publisher.
Estes issued a statement declar
ing:
“I hope I do not have an investi
gation of this committee to thank
for this surprise and unauthorized
shake-down.""
Estes, whose name was brought
into the inquiry last week during
questioning of John W. Carpenter,
president of the Texas Power and
Light company, said he had
brought to Washington “checks for
my expenses here in opposition to
the creation of a federal oil dicta
torship, totaling $882.13.”
""However,” he continued, “there
is another one which I had when
I came to Washington. I think in
the amount of approximately S2OO,
which was stolen from my rooms
in the Mayflower hotel Saturday
afternoon, when my quarters were
ransacked from top to bottom
while I was on a trip to Great
Falls.”
Estes, Lonview, Texas, publisher,
said his name was “unnecessarily
dragged into this investigation.”
“I have not been paid a penny by
either an oil company or a utility,
either in the form of advertising or
in money for salary or expense in
curred in connection with federal
legislation, affecting either oil in
dustry or utilities.”

Reply Made To
Charges Filed
By Mrs. Keaton
LOS ANGELES, July 29. (U.R)—
Leah Clampitt Sewell, accused re
cently of stealing the affections of
Buster Keaton, dead-pan film
comedian, today accused her accus
er of association with men other
than the screen star.
Mrs. Sewell, who has spent most
of her time recently in one court
or another, claimed that the sec
ond Mrs. Keaton kept Keaton in a
state of intoxication so that he
would not know of her attentions
to other men.
Keaton’s first wife was Natalie
Talmadge, sister of Norma and
Constance Talmadge of motion
picture fame. She divorced him.
Mrs. Sewell’s charges were made
in her answer to Mrs. Keaton’s
$200,000 suit against her in which
Mrs. Keaton charged her with mis
behavior with Keaton.
“That for the purpose of keep
ing her husband out of the way in
order that she might continue the
association with said men, the
plaintiff (Mrs. Keaton) kept Kea
ton under the influence of intox
icating liquor an d has arranged
bridge games for him in order that
his time might be occupied, there
by permitting the plaintiff the op
portunity to associate with other
men without arousing suspicions,”
a portion of Mrs. Sewell’s answer
read.
Mrs. Sewell, wife of Barton Se
! well, multi-millionaire yachtsman.
| recently was involved in the Se-
I well-Emerson “wife-trading case.”
BOY DECLARED
FIRST TO FIND
GOLD IN WEST
DANVILLE, Calf.. July 29 KU.R)—
—George Van Gorcron, 90-year-old
rancher and horse-breeder, arises
to say John Marshall was not the
first person to discover gold in
California.
“It was a 10-year-old boy. John
Wimmer,"" recalled Van Gordon.
“His father worked for Gen. John
A. Sutter at Coloma. John gave
the nugget he found to his father,
who gave it to John Marshall, who
gave it to Mrs. Wimmer, and she
boiled it in the soap kettle. I've
heard the Wimmers tell the story
many times.”
Van Gordon perhaps knows. He
came to California in 1846, remem
bers how everyone abandoned his
work and rushed to the gold fields
He remembers Lola Montez, the
dancer; Joaquin Murietta, most
vengeful and dashing cf American
bandits, and the Vigilantes.

FRANCE MAKES
TRAVEL RATES
FOR ROMANCE
PARIS, July 29 (U.R)—All French
newly-weds who spend their hon
eymoons in Algeria via the Medi
terranean will be guaranteed a 35
per cent reduction in traveling ex
penses by the French steamship
companies.
The tickets for this voyage will
be good for one month and can be
purchased only during the first
month of marriage. From the 31st
day on, the newlyweds will be con
sidered as old married couples, who
can stay at home and mind their
own firesides. If they do any trav
eling after that, they pay 100 per
cent cash for the privilege.
So heavy do the steamship com
panies anticipate trade in this! di
rection that a new ship will be
launched at St. Nazaire for the
Marseilles-Algiers run, and will en
ter the regular service in June.
According to last minute infor
mation, the new ship will have a
displacement of 8760 tons and a
speed of from 21 to 22 knots. It will
accommodate 140 first class honey
mooners, or rather first class pas
sengers—B3 in the “mixed” class,
220 in second, 173 in third, and 400
in fourth.
It is expected that in this way
the French steamship companies
will endear themselves to all new
lyweds, and they promise faithfully
to make “happiness” the keynote of
their boats.

Indiana Drivers To

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 29
(U.R)—The truck and pleasure car
drivers have adopted an unwritten
law to lessen the hazards of night
driving, according to Maurice Tuc
ker, president of Indiana Motor
Traffic Association, Inc.
When a motorist wishes to pass
a truck he is expected to flicker his
headlights. The truck driver will
flicker his taillight in response if
the road ahead is clear.
His recognition of the approach
ing car is followed by moving close
to the right edge of the road to al
low the other vehicle plenty of
room to pass. ■'

THE NEWS TO

RESIDENTS
THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION
NEEDS NO AMENDINii
Tuesday night, Lieut. Gov. George J.
Hatfield told guests and members of the
El Centro Business and Professional
Women’s clubs why he believes the fed
eral constitution needs no new amend
ments. His reasoning was clearcut and
concise, and would need a lot of rebut
ting to change the minds of listeners.
The Federal constitution, he said, has
been acclaimed as the greatest instru
ment ever struck off by the hand of
man. The world’s most famous author
ities concur in this opinion. It was not
the result only of one particular meet
ing, but the outgrowth of centuries of
experience throughout the previous his
tory of England. Faced with opportunity
to create what they felt was the most
perfect government possible, and un
hampered by great accumulations of
laws and statutes, the leaders of the
thirteen colonies drew upon England’s
experience and inculcated in their docu
ment, the best possible checks and bal
ances. The majority of the people of
this country feel the constitution needs
no changing. Under its clauses, it per
mits the greatest possible liberty with
the greatest possible safety. If freedom
of action is to be increased for executive
or legislative or judicial bodies, some
thing must be sacrificed and obviously,
this means weakening the safety provi
sions. In the previous history of this
country it has not been found necessary
to alter continually the constitution and
we do not believe it is necessary now.
There may be some more profound argu
ments in favor of changing the consti
tution than has come our way, and if so
everyone should listen carefully and
weigh the testimony. It would, however,
take a deal of evidence and a long time
to consider it, before this country should
embark upon such a risky business as
changing the very foundation stones of
the nation’s structure.

THE POST-PRESS:
I don't see why you don’t do something
about the slot machine situation here in El Cen
tro. My boy •who works after school has gotten
into trouble. Money that he collected in con
nection with his work was spent in gambling
in these machines and it was only by my telling
his employer, the (name of firm) that I would
someway and somehow make back the money,
that I kept the boy out of more serious trouble.
I am barely making a living for my family of
wife and three children, and can’t afford to pay
off the $35.00 of company money which my boy
wasted in those machines. My. boy isn’t a crook
in any sense of the word. He just was an in
nocent victim of these machines which, in spite
of our laws, are kept in just about every drug
store and refreshment place all over town. They
teach young people to take chances, and will get
others into the same trouble that my boy is in.
I realize your paper can’t correct all things
wrong -with a town, such as this, especially
where gambling is done openly and accepted as
the regular thing. But Ido think you should
try to keep these temptations away from young
sters who might get the gambling habit with
serious results.

THE UMEXRECTED
Famous Sayings
“The blame for the danger to world peace lies not
in the world population, but in the political leaders
of that population.""—Franklin D. Roosevelt.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD
LET THE HON US HILL PASS
Wednesday, the new compromise
bonus bill is scheduled to come up be
fore the House of Representatives.
Doubtless it will pass by a heavy vote.
The next move is up to President Roose
velt and, to be consistent, he will prob
ably veto it with or without expression
of reasons. These reasons have been ex
pressed before and they are good. Brief
ly summarized, they are (1) that pay
ment of the bonus represents the ability
of a minority to force an expense on the
majority; (2) That as an aid to the de
pression, it is not properly discrimina
tory because it distributes funds equally
to all veterans whether they need the
money or not. We believe however, that
his viewpoint is not entirely correct. In
the first place, this is not a decision to
give the veterans a bonus. That decision
was made long since, when congress
dec’ded the men who were in service
deserved more recompense than they
received. They were not given cash, how
ever, but were given certificates in the
nature of promissory notes, to be paid
in full if the veteran lived long enough
and if he didn’t use up the loan value.
The present decision of congress is one
of whether these notes, as it were, should
be paid now in the form of bonds which,
if the veteran is not in need, may be
retained indefinitely, but which, if the
veteran is in need, can be cashed and the
money received spent and put into circul
ation. Various communities already are
estimating the amount of cash which
would start flowing. Such money would
perform several duties with the same
dollars. It would provide relief benefits
hi many cases, pay off an obligation, and
speed up business. It is hoped the Pres
ident either signs the bill or lets it pass
without signature, thus doing away with
this troublesome problem.

TULARE TIMES
Mirror of The Community
It has been aptly said that a town is best
judged by its newspaper. A certain impression
will be gained in any city you pass through by
noting its business houses, public buildings and
residential district. But to get an accurate idea
of what kind of people live in the community,
how modern and progressive the stores actually
are, what kind of services and facilities are
available to the resident, whether its people are
friendly, cooperative, public spirited and civic
minded—one needs only to obtain a copy of the
local newspaper. By turning through its pages
you can discover at a glance what type of mer
chants it really has, what kind of civic leaders
and organizations it contains and whether they
are doing a worthwhile work. In fact, you can
quite readily discover what the town “thinks”—
its real character. Whatever you find a “live”
newspaper you can be sure it is the reflection
of a “live"" community.

* FARM BIBLE
* RURAL SURVEY
* MAP PROGRAM .......
* NEW GOALS
By RODNEY DUTCHER
WASHINGTON, The report of
the “regional adjustment” survey
of last year, in which agricultural
experiment stations of 48 states
collaborated with scientists and of
ficials of AAA and other Depart
ment of Agriculture bureaus, is the
“bible” of officials now seeking to
work out details of the domestic
allotment-soil conservation pro
gram ‘with which they hope to re
place the Agricultural Adjustment
act, knocked out by the U. S. Su
preme Court.
Purpose of that survey was to
recommend systems and schedules
of farming and ranching for vari
ous areas which would check soil
depletion or erosion and at the
same time stimulate farm practices
which would lower production
costs.
Estimates w£re made of the ef
fect of such program on production
and the probable change in terms
of acreage.
On the basis of results, AAA
seeks to judge the most de
sirable goals for total acreage and
total volume of production of spe
cific commodities, and, according
to H. R. Tolley—prominent now in
administration farm councils—must
work out the best possible com
promise as between:
1. The need of farmers for ade
quate prices and income.
2. National consumption needs.
3. Condition of soils and vari
ous farm management problems in
each region.
About 700 type-of-farming areas
were catalogued. General recom
mendations for the big key areas
are, in part, the following and
bear in mind that it is proposed
to pay farmers for their share in
making the changes:
CORN BELT: Reduction in corn
and oats; increase in soybeans, hay,
and pasture; decrease in number
of hogs; substantial increase in
dairy cows and milk production;
moderate increase in beef cattle
and sheep. Resulting increase in
hay and milk production would be
especially marked in lake states
region.
SOUTH: Decrease of cotton
acreage below normal level; in
crease in total crop land, pasture,
and all southern feed crops ex
cept corn. Considerable increase
for all kinds of livestock produc
tion chiefly to improve living
standards.
GREAT PLAINS AND PACIFIC
NORTHWEST WHEAT REGIONS:
Decrease in pre-AAA wheat acre
age; removal of low-yield ‘wheat
land from production. Increases
of feed production in hard winter
wheat, spring wheat, and Pacific
Northwest areas.
RANGE REGION: Chiefly, a
slight decrease in number of cat
tle from the low level prevailing
in either 1930 or 1935, with in
crease of hay production to pro
vide more winter feed. In a ten
year period it is believed that sta
bilization of cattle and sheep pop
ulations in this area at or near
present low levels would result in
improvement of ranges, with a

NEW YORK. Jan. 22.—A gag of

mining towns is now one of the
divertissements of the flossy New

hard-panners came to camp for
a binge they received, when they
had reached the sleeping stage,

Among the snoring boozers
around the big bellied stoves in
the grogs of Cripple Creek during
the gold rush, it inspired several
shootings. The “hot foot” is an
old fashioned match stuck in the

burns to the end. there is a scream
and epileptic jig.

Wall Street and Politics
Norman Thomas on Townsendism . . . Believes It
Doomed to Failure . . . Will Reach Peak . . .
By LESLIE EICHEL
(Central Press Staff Writer)
NEW YORK.—Norman Thomas,
intellectual leader cl the Socialists,
gets around the country more con
sistently than anybody else —at
least, so it seems. And, as an
observer, he seems unbiased, for
he can gain no office —nor will he
be favored.
How far will Townsendism as
cend?
Thomas believes he can discern
its peak. It may rise until it ap
pears to have a majority in con
gress. Then it will descend.
""But suppose the plan should
pass congress. It would not work.
Then it would fail anyway.”
Thomas considered a moment:
""The danger in the Townsend
plan lies in its attracting people
from the real problems.
“Here we have a promise—a
plan—to ‘end all troubles'. People
find in it an escape—an easy road.
""There is no such easy road.
“The fight for one’s rights re
quires intense organization—not
for a cure-all scheme, but for so
cial and economic readjustment.
""The Townsend plan offers a
cough-drop to cure tuberculosis.
""The good doctor himself be
lieves in his plan, but organizers
are merely organizers.
“The sad part of it all is that
the people being attracted by the
plan are being drawn away from
the very liberal organizations that
could bring aid to them —real aid,
reform that would last for ages.

Thomas reflected: “Oh, it may

all liberal groups—giving congress

imperial valley press.,['El Centro'],1936-12-27,"What Mammy Pleasant’s Sinister Power?
The Story of Mammy Pleasant Began 88 Years Ago in San Francisco and Continued
Through the Pre-Civil War South and Into Houses of 11l Repute, and Ended the Way
of Most Stories as Mammy Died in Poverty.
By Virginia Munn Finch
IT WAS called the ""House of Mystery”!
Strange, unnatural things happened there—
intrigue, tragedy, death! But strangest of all
was the power of the old Negro woman who
lived in the house. From this eerie dwelling at
1661 Octavia Street in San Francisco, the
shrewd and crafty Negress whom the world
knew as Mammy Pleasant, ruled not only the
Thomas Bel) family for whom she ostensibly
worked, but half the politicians in the State of
California. Even a governor came under her
strange power—a power that she carried with
her to her grave.
Intrigue coupled with mystery from time im
memorial has captured the attention of people.
There is an elusive fascination about whomso
ever or whatsoever is shrouded in the cloak of
the unknown. Suspense is exciting—the more
suspense and the longer it is sustained, the more
exciting. That's why the story of Mammy Pleas
ant is still told today. Mammy is long since
dead, but the strange tales of mystery and scan
dal connected with her, walk like ghosts in the
minds of the curious. Those who have heard
her story are still in suspense—kept guessing
at her secrets, which were the source of her
amazing power.
The story of Mammy begins 88 years ago,
at the time when the often-heard rumors that
gold had been discovered in California becamfe
fact, and untold thousands seeking fortune
flowed like endless streams into the West.
In the eventful year of 1848, there arrived
in San Francisco a young woman, Mary Ellen
Pleasant—quick wiited, shrewd and alert—who
was destined to become a notoriously well
known character, not only in the gold rush days
but throughout the remainder of the nineteenth
century. She was the “Mammy” Pleasant who
became one of the West’s most colorful figures
a forceful woman to whom power far super
seded wealth in importance. Both power and
wealth came to her through her ability to find
out things about the great and the near great
and to keep their secrets. Her story is one of
unfathomable intrigue, packed full of amazing
incidents, each flavored with its mystery, its
suspense, and its baffling denouement.
Born at Boston, in August 1814, Mary Ellen
Williams was the illegitimate child of a free
Louisiana Negress and a Cherokee Indian. She
was dark skinned, but mainly, her features were
dominated by her Indian blood, having the
prominent cheek bones, a high-bridged nose
and well-formed lips. Her eyes, however, were
astonishing! One was blue and the other brown!
Her childhood was most unhappy and wretched.
She begged on the streets. She was forced to
commit petty crimes and live mostly by her
wits. In her twentieth year, Lady Luck smiled
on her, and she met and married a well-to-do
free Cuban Negro named Alexander Smith. At
the time of his death in 1844, his estate totalled
$45,000, which he left to Mary Ellen with the
stipulation that some of this money be used
toward furthering the Abolition Movement
which was then sweeping over the country.
Two years after his death, Mary Ellen
Intrigue! Mystery! Tragedy! Death! Horror!
Tyrant Was John Brown’s Aide
again married, and this time it was one John
Pleasant, a former employee of the deceased
Smith. With him, she arrived in San Francisco
early in 1848. For a short time they lived to
gether, but soon he dropped out of her life,
probably because he couldn’t figure very attrac
tively in her plans for the future. It is known
that he died, and also that he was not mourned.
Shrewd as she was, it was only natural for
her to quickly take advantage of the many op
portunities to make a fortune that the early
gold rush days in San Francisco offered. Being
a splendid cook, she was in great demand and
it was not long before she was offered as much
as five hundred dollars a month for her serv
ices.
She decided, instead, to open a boarding
house for bachelors. Finding a house on Wash
ington Street, she lavishly furnished it, and had
as regular boarders and guests such men as
Newton Booth, Sharon, Broderick, Terry and
scores of other rising men of the moment Her
fame spread, and it was necessary as well as
profitable for her to open other houses of less
pretensions and less respectability. For it must
be said of Mammy that she not only set a fine
table but she also arranged with finesse all man
ner of entertainment —from cards and an occa
sional highball to female companionship. She
knew the tastes of her male boarders, and sup
plied them quickly and efficiently. Through such
tactics she intimately knew all the private in
discretions of these wealthy and prominent gen
tlemen, all of which gave her a tremendous
amount of power. Money rained down upon her.
It was common gossip that Mammy Pleasant
had decided that San Francisco was not to be
a city without women. Hence many houses ca
tering to less elite and cheaper trade, were ac
tually hers, but which she openly did not
acknowledge.
While busy with her own fortunes, Mammy
had not forgotten the stipulation of her first
husband to aid the slaves of America. She had
a genuine interest in securing their freedom,
not only as a cause, but also for the Negro as
a race. In 1858—10 years after her arrival in
San Francisco, she went to Boston, met John
Brown and gave him a check for $30,000 which
he was to use toward obtaining arms and am
munitions and completing plans for the revolt
of the Negroes against their owners.
Disguised as a jockey, sometimes in other
ways, Mammy went South, going from planta
tion to plantation, from state to state, organ
izing and converting Negroes to the cause, help
ing them escape to the North and Canada, via
the underground railway, and giving them food
and money to get across the Mason-Dixon Line.
All of this effort went for naught. John Brown’s
raid at Harper’s Ferry in October 1859 was
premature. He had not gotten in touch first
with Mammy as he had agreed. He Was cap
tured, tried and hanged and an active search was
made to find his accomplices. Consequently,
Mammy was forced to flee to New York where
she hid out for a time.
IT IS interesting to know that Mammy could
neither read nor write, although she did learn
to sign her own name. In one of John Brown’s
The Fatal Stair

of Thomas Bell
at 1661 Octavia
Street.

Francisco Street Corners.
pockets was found a note, the message of which
was in one handwriting, and the signature,
“M. E. P.” in another. The message read, ""The
ax is laid at the root of the tree. When the
first blow is struck, there will be more money
to help.”
Disillusioned with her efforts to reform, this
ended, so far as is known. Mammy’s anti
slavery activities. Eventually, she returned to
San Francisco to resume management of her
houses.
Soon Mammy had dozens of then powerful
financial and political barons dancing at the end
of a string. They were her puppets and when
she pulled the strings they moved as she di
rected. Such a network of interlapping evidence
did she have against the political powers of the
State that she could indirectly influence dozens
of men whom she had never met. She figured
prominently in many police cases in which she
invariably cams out victorious.
There was one case in which a Negro hench
man of hers was hailed into court for perjury.
When the case seemed to be going against him,
Mammy jumped from her seat in the courtroom
and openly announced to the court that he
could not be sent to prison. She warned the
judge that if convicted, the man not only would
never serve a day in prison, but that the judge’s
own career on the bench would be at an end.
The frightened judge, of course, had no alterna
tive after this outbreak and with the evidence
as it was. The man was convicted and sen
tenced. But Mammy was right! Before he even
entered the gates of the prison, he received a
pardon. The judge soon dropped into oblivion.
Such was Mammy’s power.
Mammy’s house of ill repute at 920 Wash
ington Street was a favorite rendezvous for the
political and socially prominent men of the time.
Mammy cared for and educated an illegitimate
daughter of a one-time California governor, fol
lowing the mother's death. The Negress saw to
it that the girl’s father contributed so gener
ously that there was enough to promote other
causss than his daughter’s. In his will, the gov
ernor. then retired to private life, left his daugh
ter. without acknowledging her as such, a share
of his estate. Feeling that she had not been
left her just due, the girl, at the instigation of
Mammy, contested the will, won her case and
obtained a handsome settlement. There were
other cases—many of them—but Mammy is
more closely identified with the Bell family
than any other.
FOR years, a frequent visitor to Mammy’s
houses was a Scotchman, Thomas Bell. who.
previous to his arrival in San Francisco in
his early thirties, had held banking positions in
London and South America. A shrewd and
canny financier, he organized the brokerage firm
of Bell and Baron, which was the agent for the
Rothschilds of London and Paris. Later. he be
came the power behind Ralston in the Bank of
California in the Comstock days It was he. too,
who promoted and built the Guatemala or Cen
tral American Railway. His fortune was es
timated to run between 15 and 20 million dol
lars.
Thomas Bell had never married. He enjoyed
the free and easy life he had led without the
hampering bonds of matrimony. An inveterate
gambler, he made and lost fortunes at one sit
ting without batting an eye As he reached 50,
he was attracted to a protegee of Mammy’s, a
girl employed in one of Mammy's houses, whose
beauty brought down the most devoted atten
tions from many of the wealthy men of the
city. Mammy was quick to see that Thomas
Bell was interested in this girl, and as a result
engineered her plans so successfully that he
moved Teresa Clingan-Harris-Percy into his
home and permitted her to add his name to
the long list already hers.
Not long after, Mammy herself moved in
with them, and straightway took a firm hand
in ruling the domain. She planned an elaborate
home for the couple at 1661 Octavia Street.
Every detail of Mammy’s plans was carried out,
from the mansard roof, to the circular stair-

Millionaire, Paid

Child. Rumor Has

vflay extending from the basement to the attic,
and the lavish ballroom lined with mirrors from
floor to ceiling.
It was Mammy who manipulated the mar
riage between Thomas and Teresa after they
had begun life in .their new home—that is, a
marriage ceremony performed by Father Bres
lin. a Catholic priest, but a ceremony for which
no civil license had been obtained.
Almost immediately there Ensued a vehement
quarrel between the newly-married pair, which
terminated’in Teresa’s hasty departure from the
house with bag and baggage. Bell had her ar
rested and returned and from then on they lived
in a divided house she on one side and he on
the other, with Mammy as the intermediary.
Alone in his side of the house Thomas Bell
brooded. If he had children his life would be less
lonely. But he was not on particularly good
terms with his wife. Mammy plotted with him.
It was decided that with each child Teresa pre
sented to Bell, she was to receive a cash settle
ment' of $50,000. As speedily as the laws of na
ture allowed, she produced six children—three
girls, Robina May, Muriel and Marie Teresa —
three boys, Reginald, Eustace and Thomas Fred
erick.
After Thomas Bell’s death great controversy
arose among his direct heirs over his will. It
was taken to court time and time again. In the
trial during September 1897, Mammy testified,
that Thomas Frederick and. Marie Teresa Bell
were not Teresa Clingan Bell’s own children.
That Thomas Bell had brought these children
as babies to the ranch where Mammy lived and
asked her to care for them a year before
Thomas Bell had married Teresa. This testi
mony all the more backed up the ugly rumors
which had circulated throughout the years that
all six children had not been borne by Teresa,
even though she was crafty enough to have col
lected a cool $300,000 on them, from her hus
band.
THROUGHOUT Mammy’s career, it is evident
that she not only directed and enjoyed steer
ing the Bell family's various intrigues among
its different members, but she took an especially
keen delight in arranging the affairs of others
as well.
In 1875, Senator Sharon became the enemy of
Thomas Bell when he secured the control of the
Bank of California after its failure. Probably
as a means of revenge, Mammy introduced
Sharon to Sarah Althea Hill, who immediately
became Sharon’s mistress. Growing tired of her
rather quickly, he tried to disentangle himself
from the liaison, with the result that Sarah
Althea filed suit against him in which she pro
duced a marriage certificate to back up her
claims. She lost her case. It was common gos
sip that Mammy Pleasant had spent SIOO,OOO of
Thomas Bell’s money in backing her protegee.
After the trial Sarah Althea was courted by
her attorney, the former Judge Terry They
married. A feud arising during the trial between
Terry and Justice Fields culminated in the death
of Terry, who was shot down by one of Fields’
henchmen. Sarah Althea Hill lost her mind, and
it was Mammy who stepped in, to instigate pro
ceedings whereby the unfortunate Althea was
placed in an asylum.
In the meantime, Thomas Bell was growing
old, and weak, and feeble, with frequent faint
ing spells and attacks of vertigo. Mammy re
mained with the family, deftly managing the
large household, doing the marketing each
morning and engineering quarrels among the
nearly-grown children.
At a late hour one night in October 1892,
Thomas Bel) was found sprawled out in the
courtyard unconscious. He had apparently fallen
from the balcony three flights above He died
without regaining consciousness. A red shawl
belonging to Mammy was found in extremely
close proximity to where he met his death, and
when the servants went to Mammy’s quarters
to arouse her. she immediately appeared at the
door erttirely clothed despite the fact that the
rest of the household had been in bed for hours.
Police suspected that Bell had not accidentally
fallen from the balcony, but the case was al
lowed to drop.
It is coincidental that four years later,
Thomas Frederick Bell met with an accident
which was almost the exact duplicate of that
causing the death of his father. He fell over
the bannister of the circular stairway from a
high point down into the courtyard below. For
several days he lay unconscious and was bed-

ridden for a period of eight or ten weeks. Was
Mammy’s sinister influence behind either of
these “accidents”? No matter what question
was put to Mammy when she took the stand
in frequent court sessions, she was always
shrewdly able to clear her own name and es
cape any penalty of the law.
IN THE sensational court hearing in 1897, at
the time Thomas Frederick, known as Fred
Bell, sought to have Teresa Clingan Bell re
moved’ as guardian of his minor brothers and
sisters, alleging incompetency, the trial brought
out the startling statement that neither he nor
his sister, Marie Teresa, were Mrs. Bell’s chil
dren. However, their father had named them
specifically in his will as his own, and whether
or not they were actually his blood children
or adopted was not determined. Mammy up
held Mrs. Bell in her statement that only* four
children had been born to her. She appeared in
court and took her oath on it.
At the hearing Fred Bell brought a jeweler
into court who testified that Mammy had left
diamonds valued at SIOO,OOO, the property of
Mrs. Bell, with him for safekeeping. The wit
ness stated that Mammy came for the jewels
soon after Thomas Bell’s death. Another wit
ness testified that he had kept laces valued at
more than SSOOO for the Bells. Both said their
dealings had been direct with Mammy. But
Mammy made satisfactory explanations to the
court as to the disposal of these valuables, and
the hearing came to naught.
Fred Bell managed to get himself into one
scrape after another. There was one in par
ticular with Alphonso Barillas, son of Guate
mala’s president, in a questionable house on
Bush Street, in which he was seriously injured,
but no specific charges were brought, and the
shroud of mystery that screened all occurrences
in which Mammy had a hand settled over the
incident.
Some years later, following the deaths of both
Mrs. Bell and Mammy, the Bell estate was un
der litigation for many years. It was only in
comparatively recent years, after investigations
that reached from San Francisco to Peru, to
China, and back again had been made, that the
court divided the estate. But the Bell family
was a strange menage, and Fred Bell strangest
of all. In less than two years after receiving
a substantial settlement, Fred was seen penni
less on a San Francisco street corner selling
apples. He died shortly after in a home for the
poor.
During the years Mammy Pleasant lived with
the Bells in the “House of Mystery” on Octavia
Street, many strange things went on behind
closed doors. Lights burned at all hours. Shad
owy figures came and went. From whence they
came, and where they went, their identity, no
one but Mammy knew, and Mammy never
talked. Following Mammy’s death, the old man
sion became virtually a ""haunted house.” Pass
ersby claimed they often saw a strange light
through the cracks of the boarded doors and
windows late at night, and Mammy’s ghost was
believed to haunt the house. The house was
finally torn down.
Mammy, before her death, quarreled vio
lently with Mrs. Bell and left her to go to
friends in Oakland who looked after Mammy
until she died at the age of 92. She was prac
tically penniless when she died. There were no
relatives—no heirs. She provided for a tomb
stone and her dying wish was that on it be
carved, “She Was A Friend of John Brown.""
There were many who breathed easier with
Mammy’s passing.
Mary Ellen Pleasant was a character unique.
She was the friend of all those whom she felt
worthy of her good graces. At the same time,
she could have made life extremely uneasy for
dozens of the State’s most prominent figures
whose lives she knew intimately. But her policy
was always silence. She was paid, and hand
somely, for what she knew, but it was the
power and not the money that intrigued her.
It is remarkable and amazing that a woman
with a heritage so meager could rise to such
great heights of power and influence—even
though in so many respects it was evil and
sinister.
A black woman who determined the destiny
of white men was Mammy Pleasant. She was
born to rule, and rule she did, not unlike a
queen from her ""palace"" on Octavia fetreet—
the ""House of Mystery.”

ACREAGE DECREASE EXPECTED IN
I. V. ASPARAGUS CROP, DORMAN
REPORTS; QUALITY IMPROVED
A slightly smaller acreage, similar market conditions
and better quality of asparagus was the forecast of George
Dorman, secretary of the Imperial"" County Asparagus
Growers association Saturday.
Dorman estimated the asparagus acreage to be 1300
acres this season and reported that ket condftions in the asparagus
approximately 60,000 crates of as
paragus would be shipped this year
in comparison to 70,000 crates last
season.
The decrease in acreage this sea
son was due to the plowing under
of several old fields of asparagus,
firman said.

market depended entirely upon gen
eral conditions and upon quality of
the product. Valley asparagus has
no competition and as a result prices
are usually comparatively high.
Shipments are divided about even
ly between the east and west coasts,
according to Dorman. During the
peak of the Season shipments are
restricted to one or two cars per
day in order to maintain a steady

In the event more crates are un

4-H CLUB ORGANIZATION PLANS
COMPLETE; ANNUAL ROUNDUP
WILL START ON MONDAY
Their long range program firmly established as a
definite part of the year’s plans, 4-H club members will
begin the annual club roundup Monday, Lee Landerman,
club director, reported Saturday.
The roundup, in which more than 500 members are
expected to enroll in 20 clubs, will
last for two weeks, Landerman said
in pointing ou that club activities
are a full month ahead of last year's
schedule. ’
Increased interest in club work
has been aroused through sugges
tion of the long range program
which will interest ciub workers in
activities over a period of years
rather than for each season.
Under the plan a large number
of the club members will be able
to build up agriculture industries
which they may step into when
ready to face the problem of mak
ing a living for themselves and for
their families.
Four new clubs. Westmorland,
Brawley, Holtville and Bard, will be
formed this year in the expansion
program planned by club leaders.
Migration to
California Shows
Steady Decrease
By RALPH 11. TAYLOR
California’s twentieth century
“gold rush”, which has brought a
stampede of more than 400.000 des
titute migrants to the state in less
than four years—drawn by the lure
of fatter relief payments, bigger
pensions, or better promise of em
ployment—has passed the peak and
is definitely tapering off.
That reassuring news comes from
W. V. Allen, California supervisor
of Farm Placement Service for the
United States Department of Labor.
Mr. Allen, whose department has
given splendid cooperation in seek
ing to stem the tide of indigent,
advises that: “From current infor
mation received from the Border
Check Station Inspectors, there
seem to be a good many migrants
leaving California at the present
time and very few entering the
state ""
That report—if the trend con
tinues—is of vital importance to all
California, but of even greater im
portance to rural California, for
Mr. Allen’s study of the Dust Bowl
invasion also reveals that most of
the migrants have settled in fann
ing areas and have become a
burden on farm taxpayers as well
as a contributing cause to farm
labor difficulties.
Indicative of the importance of
the migrant problem to California
agriculture, Mr. Allen makes this
significant analysis: “Of the 90,740
out-of-state persons actually count
ed at the borders as entering the
state of California in search of
work during 1937, 78.332, or 86.3 per
cent, were farm laborers migrat
ing from the middle west drought
states.”
VALLEY REPUBLICANS
ATTEND DINNER
Three members of the Imperial
County Republican Central com

the trip.
A Fowl Spectacle
Dusting Proves
Successful in
Pest Elimination
Experiments in dusting of cotton
in the Bard area to rid the crop
of pests were explained at a meet
ing of the cotton growers of the
valley at the Bard Experiment
station last week, according to
Frank Beyschlag, farm advisor.
J. A. Ascuith, of the Bureau of
Entomology, made the study to de
termine what, type of insects had
attacked the cotton plants, then
experimented with a series of dust
ings which completely eradicated
the insects.
Ascuith learned that four types
of bugs had bored into the cotton
crop and had caused rathei- heavy
losses, especially in the Bard sec
tion.
The lygiis, the creontiades, the
brown cotton bug and the big green
stink bug, caused the most trouble
in the cotton, Ascuith revealed.
The creontiades left the alfalfa
fields and traveled to the cotton
early in June, Ascuith determined
in his study. Later in June the ly
gus left alfalfa, the brown cotton
bug migrated in July and green
stink bug moved to cotton when all
alfalfa had bee harvested.
Experiments carried on by the
entomologist revealed that cotton
yields could be increased as much
as 900 pounds to the acre by dust
ing.
It is necessary, however, to apply
a series of dustings for results.
Instructions must be followed to
the letter, Ascuith said, or the
cause will be lost.

ing the new water facilities pro
gram of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture has been received at
the farm advisors' office at El
Centro.
Under provisions of an act passed
by Congress last year the depart
ment has $5,500,000 available to
render limited aid in the develop
ment of water facilities for agri
cultural use in arid and semi-arid
sections in the 17 western states.
The purpose is to aid in the con
servation and tire wise use of water
resources.
Facilities may be built for either
[ roup or private use. Such facil
ities may be provided which in act
ual operation will efiect the storage
or utilization of water for stock
or domestic use or for application
to crop lands. Some of the spe
cific kinds of facilities on which
the federal program offers assist
ance include reservoirs, pump in
stallations and facilities for flood
irrigation and small irrgiation fa
cilities.

TWO WORLD RECORDS SET IN FLAX
PRODUCTION IN VALLEY YIELD
DATA FOR 1938 CROP REVEALS
Authentic yield data relating to the 1938 flax crop in
the Imperial Valley has been released by L. G. Goar, super
intendent of the University of California Experiment
Station, El Centro. Goar relieves tne valley flax growers
have established at least two new world records in flax-
seed production this year to be
added to the individual grower rec
ord set up last year by Keith Mets,
Holtville, when he produced 46
bushels per acre on 13 acres, and
averaged 32 bushels per acre on
more than 400 acres.
This was a two-way world record
for commercial flax. Forty-six bush
els per acre is the highest yield yet
recorded from a commercial plant
ing, and an average yield of 32
bushels per acre on more than 400
acres by one grower is also un
precedented.
Mets Holds 1938 Record
Mets continues to lead in produc
tion in 1938 with an average yield
of 39.67 bushels per acre on 106
acres. Included in this 106 acres
were 20 acres that averaged 43.4
bushels per acre; 40 acres that
averaged 39.2 bushels; 11 acres that
averaged 38.3 bushels and 35 acres
that averaged 38.5 bushels. His
average yield on 440 acres this year
was 31.7 bushels per acre.
New World Records
The new additional world flaxseed
production records that Goar points
out as having been established in
the Imperial Valley this year are
first, the approximate 25 bushel
average yield made on the 9,000
acres operated by the members of
the Southwest Flaxseed association,
and second, the 31.74 bushel aver
age yield made on 1,926 acres oper
ated by 15 members of the associa
tion.
Goar secured from Argyle Mc-
Lachlan, secretary-treasurer of the
Southwest Flaxseed association,
with headquarters at Imperial, a
list of the members whose acreage
made up the 1,926 acres referred to
above, together with the yield of
each which follows:
Average
Grower’s Bushels Bu. per

August Axler .. .180 5,560 30.90

C. R. Walker . 160 4,500 28.10
Totals 1926 61,134 31,74
According to McLachlan this was
about 20 per cent of the associa
tion’s 1938 acreage.
There are, undoubtedly, other
flax growers in the valley who could
qualify for a place on this list of
record breaking flax producers, but
that their records were not avail
able.
Baby Beef Club
Organizes at Meet,
Hears Discussion
Four-H baby beef club members
'net at the farm advisor office in
the court house Thursday night to
elect officers, map plans for the
year and hear an address by Wal
lace Sullivan, farm management
specialist, from the College of Agri
culture.
Wallace analyzed the baby beef
club records of last years contest,
of which he is now making a sum
mary. He further went into detali
in mailing suggestions on keeping
records this year.
He stressed the importance of
keeping accurate records, proper
inventories and good management
to make tire enterprise show a
profit.
Wallace pointed out that not one
type of earning enters into these
junior farm enterprises. He listed
earnings as follows:
1. Interest from money invested.
2. Labor income (wages of work).
3. Rent for use of land.
4. Profit as wages of enterprise
itself.
Chas. L Wieman, president of
the Imperial County Farm Bureau
was present and made very com
plimentary remarks about the 4-H
clubs of the county and particular
ly the Baby Beec club.
Timely advice and instruction
was given the club members by the
leaders present. It was pointed out
that the baby beef calves need to
be gotten on to full feed in the
next four to six weeks in order
to reach the proper finish by March.,
There were 24 present at the
meeting. (
Officrs elected by the baby /beef
club at the meeting were: Btoger
Manwaring, prsident: Howard
Worthington, vice president;, Hope
Sunderman, secretaiy; Betty Cook,
treasurer; Lawrence Cook, neporter.

Rate Decrease for
Hay Shipments May
Revive Dealers
Hay dealers, driven out of busi
ness in the past two years by the
itinerant trucker, may be able to
return to active dealing in the near
future, Roy Wood, of the Hay
Growers association, said Saturday
in reviewing a rai Irate decrease
for hauling of hay from Imperial
Valley to San Diego.
The rail rate decrease will effect
shipments of hay on the San Di
ego and Eastern railway from the
valley to San Diego points. A de
crease of 10 cents per hundred
pounds of shipments of 24,000
pounds was announced by John
Donohue district freight and pas
senger agent.
This reduction Wood pointed out.
would allow dealers to handle the
hay at a profit and in competition
with the itinerant trucker.
Efforts are being made by the
Hay Growers association. Wood de
clared, to effect decrease in rail
rates from Imperial Valley to Los
Angeles markets. Such a move
would revive hay dealers in that
area and thereby give valley grow
ers a wider distribution area.
Banner Year
For Dairying
A banner year for dairying in Im
perial Valley was forecast by Walter
MacDonald, county milk inspector
Saturday.
He reported completion of the
Eiger Lowe dairy in the Elm dis
trict and indicated that several
more new dairies would be built in
the valley this winter.

EVERY REASON TO BE PROUD
OF IMPERIAL VALLEY
You can go into almost any communi
ty and you will find the chamber of com
merce there urging its citizens to boost
their community. The chambers of com
merce in Imperial Valley do the same—
with one great difference.
Imperial Valley needs not depend up
on pure imagination, exaggerated cli
mate and inspired hot air to provide
booster material.
There is every reason to be proud of
Imperial Valley. Some of those who
live here have never stopped to realize
it, but they live in one of the most re
markable communities in the western
hemisphere. The facts back up this
statement.
The valley is the richest agricultural
empire in the nation.
We are first to market, and first in
the world in total production of several
crops. Our per capita wealth is far above
most other sections of California, where
the per capita wealth exceeds that of
most states. Our scenic attractions in
clude the sand hills and the Salton Sea,
two natural wonders not duplicated any
where else in the world. Our climate —
yes, we have a climate, too —is so good in
the winter that we can afford to admit
it is not conducive to summer comfort.
On the business side of the ledger we
are all to the good. A young community,
with the financing charges that always
plague a young community, we have
nevertheless developed facilities compar
able to those of places a hundred years
or more old, and our burdens aren’t
much worse than theirs, who have had
many more years to settle up their bills.
There is not room here to list the fig
ures and facts which prove Imperial
Valley’s unusual attainments. Because
those facts and figures are unknown
even to many who live in Imperial Val
ley, they have been assembled by this
newspaper and will be presented in a
special issue next Sunday. If there are
any Doubting Thomases, held back from
praise of the valley because they believe
there is nothing to praise, they need only
read the forthcoming issue and resolve
all doubts.
There is every reason o be proud of
Imperial Valley—and the more we let
our pride be known, the quicker will be
attain the 250,000 population which is
Imperial Valley’s future.
A SIDE TRIP TO
NEW HELVETIA
Anyone going north from Imperial
Valley this summer to attend the San
Francisco Golden Gate International
Exposition- will miss what in one way is
an even more important event unless
they attend also the Sacramento-Golden
Empire Centennial celebration conducted
by Sacramento and 15 surrounding coun
ties.
The jubilee commemorates the found
ing 100 years ago by Gen. John A. Sutter
of the city of Sacramento, in an inland
empire which he named New Helvetia.
In a measure the history of Gen. Sutter
—respectively a citizen of Switzerland,
Mexico and the United States—is the
early history of California from the days
of the Dons through the frenzy of the
gold rush days.
There may not have been in Gen. Sut
ter’s mind when he established historic
Sutter Fort a vision of the state of Cali
fornia that was to grow from the seeds
he planted—but there is nothing to pre
vent those of us who came later from
honoring the daring, the hardihood and
the perseverance of this man who, in a
measure, made California possible.
Sacramento’s jubilee is, in reality
California’s jubilee, when lines of north
and south should be forgotten in com
mon rejoicing.

DURESS ON LEGISLATORS
IN RELIEF BATTLE
(Hanford Sentinel)
Picketing homes of legislators fighting
for economy in state relief is something
new on the part of workers interested in
public aid. The aim is to overawe lead
ers in the legislative bloc that is oppos
ing appropriations in the governor’s bud
get by means of threats to picket their
homes and make the families the target
of public attention.
The Workers’ Alliance, a radical or
ganization, has selected three members
of the assembly on whom to vent their
spleen if they refuse to desist from their
opposition to the relief measures. The
assemblymen are Lee Bashore, Jesse R.
Kellems and Gerald B. Kepple, all of Los
Angeles county districts. Members of
the Alliance, men and women, visited
their homes and threatened to lay a pick
et barrage if they do not cease their
opposition and vote the appropriations.
The brazen movement is as audacious
as it is unlawful. It should not be toler
ated. We are glad to note that the legis
lators in question have not only allowed
themselves to be overawed but have even
defied the workers to do their worst.
This means that the test tried out on
the Los Angeles legislators has been nil.
so far as fear is concerned, and that
such an attitude of firmness should and
will be met in the same fashion, if similar
threats be made against other members
of the legislature.
Duress is unlawful in picketing or
threats of picketing. The workers would
attempt by force to cow into submission
public officers who are seeking to do
their sworn dutv. That is a species of
lawlessness which the authorities immed
iately should take cognizance of and
thwart. The chances are that something
will be done about it. It is too high
handed to be tolerated.
LINDBERGH S JOB
(New York World-Telegram)
The American people have a habit of
turning against their heroes, and one of
its victims has been Colonel Charles A.
Lindbergh.
Once we overwhelmed him with hys
terical adulations, which he did not want.
Lately, some among us have made him
the target for bitter criticism, which he
did not deserve . . .
He has come back from Europe for a
period of active duty in the War Depart
ment’s Air Corps. He is to make a sur
vey of aviation facilities in the United
States, and undoubtedly his report will
include information he has gathered
about the air power of European na
tions.
It is a vastly important assignment,
at this time when America is undertak
ing an unprecedented expansion of mili
tary aviation . . .
Perhaps it’s too much to expect. But
it would be kind, and it would be wise,
if for once we would treat Colonel Lind
bergh. not as an object of public curios
ity, but as a young man doing an impor
tant job for us.
China has announced that it will per
mit no more captures of the giant panda.
This was a blow to the newsreel com
panies.
New York camera amateurs just had
a show of their own. Probably half the
exhibited prints were shots of family
pyramids on the beach.
Field Marshal Goering is losing weight.
Maybe he’s worried about having to de
liver on some of those threats he’s made.
Editorials and Comment
Bruce Catton in Washington
Dissects the News
WASHINGTON. One of the
oldest rows in Washington is com
ing to a head again as a result of
the reorganization talk.
Having grouped lending, welfare,
and construction activities in new,
unified agencies. President Roose
velt is now reported to be consider
ing a similar regrouping of conser
vation bureaus; and the thing that
is causing the row is the sugges
tion that the Forest Service may
be taken out of the Department of
Agriculture and placed in the Inte
rior Department—along, it is hint
ed. with the Department of Com
merce's Bureau of Fisheries.
Involved in the row are not mere
ly the usual bureaucratic elements
which can be counted on to raise
a howl whenever the established
order is tampered with, but also
some highly important business in
terests which fear that the transfer
would work to their disadvantage.
A year ago the same transfer
was in the wind. At that time the
Forest Service people objected
strenuously to the change; even
more strenuous, however, were the
objections from the lumber and
grazing people of the west. All that
was actually proposed at that time
Dale

Are you .superstitious? And have
you been taunted about it? Well,
if so. don't worry tor you have ; ; cod
company.
In the spring of 1909. Admiral
later. Commander Richard E. Byrd
was the first man ever to fly over
the North Pole, and as he flew over
it. he had pinned to his shirt the
same gcod luck coin that Peary
had cart led and he actually rub
bed it with his fingers the moment
he flew over the Pole That little
good luck coin »s the only known
object that has ever been to the
North Pole twice.
Napo’ecn Bonaparte conquered
Europe and changed the map
around as if it were a jigsaw puz
zle—yet he was afraid of black
cats.
Peter the Great was the most
famous and cruel Czar who ever
sat on the bloody throne of Rus
sia. He was so cruel that he mur
dered his own son. yet he was afraid
to cross t*. tiny bridge unless lie
made a holy sign.
Lord Nelson is the greatest naval
hero in England history, yet he was
sc superstitious that he had a horse
shoe nailed to the mast of his ship
during the famous battle of Trafal
gar.
Dr. Samuel Johnson, one of the
most brilliant intellects in all the
annals of English literature, was
so superstitious that he struck every
lamp post that he passed with his
cane.
The day after Abraham Lincoln
was elected President, he looked
into a mirror and saw his body re
flected with two faces and one of
them very pale: he feared that was
a sign of oncoming death.
George Washington had an iron
band put on his stepdaughter. Pat
sy. to cure her of epilepsy. Think
of it. But she finally died of epil
epsy, so I guess the Iron ring was
no protection after all.
Matthew C. Brush, a director in
47 corporations and the head of
a hundred million dollar invest
ment trust, has hundreds of ivory
elephants in hi.s home.
He says that years ago. when
lie was the president of the Boston
Elevated Railways, a strike was on.
and he was worried. A little girl
brought him a tin elephant and
told him that it would bring him
good luck. A few days later the
strike was settled to his satisfaction
anil ever since then, he has been
collecting “good luck’’ elephants.
Now when he has an important
decision to make, he always holds
a little elephant between his sec
ond and third fingers for luck.
When the stock market is going
up, he wears a blue silk tie em
broidered with a white elephant.
So don't allow people to make
you think yourself crazy if you
are superstitious. But don't let
jour superstition drive you to silly
antics, or get between you and your
goal. 11 it doesn't do these things,
then lx* superstitious and don't
worry about it.

rivalry in the whole government,
service is that which exists between
the Forest Service and the National
Park Service of the Interior De
partment.
As the names imply, Forest Ser
vice has charge of the national for
ests and Park Service has charge
of the national parks. Practically
all of the national parks are either
surrounded entirely bj’ national for
ests or are bordered bj* them. Each
outfit has its own forest rangers,
its own foresters, its own fire
fighters—and its own set of rules
and regulations.
Lumber companies may not touch
the trees in the national parks. In
the national forests, however, lum
bering is permitted, under care
ful regulation. Commercial grazing
is not permitted in national parks
but is (under regulation) in the
forests. Water power in the na
tional parks is not available to ex
ploitation but is in the forests.
The business interests which have
permits to use these resources in
the national forests fear that if the
transfer is made, the same sort of
rules which now govern the national
parks will eventually govern the
national forests; that no lumbering
or grazing will be allowed and that
the water resources will be with
drawn from public use. Naturally
enough, they are pretty strongly
opposed to the change.
Noi does tile Forest Service like
the idea. The rivalry between the
two organizations is something like
that which infects the enlisted per
sonnel of tdie njivy and the marine
corps. It extends all the way to
the rangers and fire-fighters out
in the field. Consequently when
the shift is mentioned it is inevit
able that a certain amount of pres
sure is pul on Congress to pre
vent it.
If the transfer does go through.
Secretary Harold Ickes will have
gone a long way toward making
the Interior Department a depart
ment of conservation—whether the
name is actually changed or not.
Ickes' theory is that the depart
ment ought to be primarily a de
partment for the physical adminis
tration and husbanding of the na
tion’s physical resources.

Hints on Etiquette
The announcement to friends of
an engagement to marry is usually
given at. a dinner in honor of the
engaged couple, the young woman’s
father or older brother making the
announcement. Sometimes the girl
gives a party for her intimate
friends and then tells them about
the event.
Today's Horoscope
For those whose birthday is on
this date a favorable year is in
sight. There is. however, an excep
tion to this prophesy. Take care to
curb your temper and refrain from
quarreling. Otherwise a great deal
of trouble and some loss will come
to you. The child born today also
will be fortunate throughout life.
He or she will be ambitious and
determined, with a tendency to be
hyper-critical, quick tempered and
exacting in demands. A strong sense
of justice will, however, temper
these traits somewhat.

Willis Thornton's Editorial Or
U. S. and Canada, Best of Good Neighbors
To paraphrase Master Shake
speare. some countries achieve
amity with their neighbors, some
are born friendly, and some have
a peaceful relationship thrust upon
them. •
But in the relations between the
United States and Canada, both
are fortunate in being bound by all
three conditions. We have achiev
ed mutually cordial relations by 100
years of their conscious develop
ment. we are born naturally friend
ly and in key with one another, and
our geographical and economic re
lationship thrust us one upon the
other in so emphatic a way that
any but the most friendly relations
would be ridiculous.
Often we take this relationship
for granted, so accustomed to it
have we become. We strive to im
prove relations with Mexico. Cen
tral and South America, which is
eminently proper. But we are’ apt
to take Canada for granted, and
she us.
We seldom think about the inter
weaving of destiny that is drawing
irresistibly together the two great
countries. When President Roo.se
velt gave renewed assurance that
the United States stood ready to de
fend Canada against any foreign
invasion, nobody was much sur
prised. He only .said what every
body knew would be the ease in
practice anyway.
Obviously neither country could
feel safe if a foreign force got a

not concern Canada equally with
the United States? International
affairs, especially those of the last
20 years, have been putting the two
countries, even more emphatically
than they have put all the Ameri
can countries, into the same boat.
It would not be at all surprising
to see Canada some day a partici
pant in Pan-American conferences,
from which her status as an em
pire dominion has hitherto barred
her.
But we also sometimes forget that
the trade between the United States
and Canada is 3 per cent of all
world trade, and greater than that
between any other two countries.
While U. S. exports to China in
1937 were under 50 millions. Canada
was taking more than 500 millions
in American goods. She was mean
while sending back about 400 mil
lions. And this apparently un
favorable balance was more than
made up by U. S. tourist traffic
going into Canada, estimated for
1938 at 150 millions.
One-third of all U. S. foreign
long-term investments are in Can
ada, nearly four billions, but that
is no one-way affair, lor Canada
has invested at least a billion in
the United States.
So closely interwoven a relation
ship as this needs no political ties,
and no formal alliances to em
phasize that the two great coun
tries ate growing closer as each
year passes, and that in respect to

IT S TIME FOR
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
Utfht is the grandest symbol of
mas.
A light—the glowing spark of tin- >t; v
of Bethlehem—heralded the i-omir.g of
Jesus Christ, and the greatest l:g! ' -
all—the light of eternal fello\vship--was
His gift to thv world.
We pay Him too little conscious tv.
on the day that bears his name, although,
our every generous deed at uletide is
an unconscious tribute to His teachings.
This year, as in past years. K 1 i\’ntra:.
will string lights and prepare illuminated
decorations about their homes it. w* U- -■
to the Christmas season.
This year, more than ever betore.
us set out our lights with conscious know !-
edge that they are but tiny sparks agai:
the brilliance ol’ His presence In t:r. i
when darkness threatens half tin- wm :
because barbarians have forgotten wr.nt
He taught, let us stand forth w:th
visible pledge that light shall m<t !.. .
and that what He t.night will li\ T-t
--ever.
America has a gigantic job of light;’ g
to do this year, to make up for tin dark
spots that will dot thv globe when ( hi st
mas comes again. K 1 Centro has a part
of that job to do.
Christmas lights, shining with a bril
liance that will far exceed their oun
worldly range, this year must carry the
message to the doubter- within our own
ranks, and to the waiting legions through
out the world, that the lamp of fellow
ship and love lighted by Jesus Christ
will not grow dimmer, but will shine
with a glow that grows stronger and
brighter as the days and years pass.
When you put up your Christmas lights
this year. !>e they two or a hundred, re
member and think upon the tact tha
they are the symbols of a greater light
the light of a love beyond selfishness.
DO YOU KNOW
IMPERIAL COUNTY?
A speaker at the Associated C hambers
of Commerce meeting the other night
voiced an undeniable truth when he
pointed out that tourist travel is of con
siderable commercial importance to farm
ers and all other residents ol the vallyy.
Imperial Valley’s big problem remains
that of attracting more tourists, and ot
keeping more of them here as wint’-r
residents.
One way everybody can In . p is by
knowing more about Imperial county.
It is surprising—almost startling—how
little some residents of this area know'
about their immediate surroundings. Too
many of us fall into the habit of thinKU.-'
that the irrigated area of the valley .<
Most of us, of course, have visit 1
the whole county.
Salton Sea. and the mud volcanoes re at
there, and the Sand Dunes, and po.-sioly
Painted Gorge, and all of us have driven
across the desert at one time or another.
But how many of us know the other
things that are to be found in this coun
ty? The mining country, for instant"",
where there was a gold rush long lxlore
the Alaskan gold discoveries. (Jr the
petrified forests, or the fossil clam and
oyster beds. Or the old Butterfield lint
stage stations. How many of us aiy
closely acquainted with the wierd. fasci
nating appearance of some parts ol our
desert ?
We cannot ever completely sell this
county to those from ‘•outside"" unless
we know the county ourselves. Attempt
ing to do so. we are like an automobil--
salesman trying to sell an automobil*-.
yet who cannot answer any of the ques
tions his prospective customer asks.
Imperial county is a grand plat--, and
a big place. Ihe more you know it. 1 :.e
better you like it. and the more inter
esting you find it. We all ought to g< •*
better acquainted with it.

Careful compilations are said to
show that a growing share of to
talitarian propaganda ccmes from
Americans —not anti-interventionists
alone but also from objective writers
and commentators on our defense
effort and politics. They supply
Gcebbeis with gambits and Hitler
with histrionics, and the German
military and naval intelligence ser
vices with information worth many
spies.
But so do government agencies.
For in. tance. there is the Maritime
Commission's public invitation to
Nazi submarines to lurk off Boston
and sink our .supply ship, headed
lor Russia. Reasons? Most Ameri
cans either don't under '.aid war or
don't understand we are in this

not surprising. Crack down? Cen

MONDAY, DEC KM HER 1, 1941
Many officers believe they will prove
best of all company officers.
liI.ACK I Oft HEDS
Latest careful study of Russian
situation by military authorities fits
into this capsule:
Russians have lost or soon must
lose all but 25 to 35 per cent of
their industrial capacity. Same ma
chinery moved back cannot be fullly
utilized until spring when Germany
begins to get real income from cap
tured Russian iron, copper, alumi
num and wheat.
Russian army may escape crush
ing defeat this fall or winter, and
along a naturally strong line like
the Volga may hold until spring,
but a counter-offensive is very
doubtful- Standing on defense, the
Soviets can pin down only 100 Ger
man divisions. That leaves 200 for
garrisoning conquered countries and
attacking elsewhere.
The British have 05 to 73 division,
incompletely equipped. Only way to
be sure of saving Russia, to say
nothing of strengthening her tor
anything like counter-offensive that
might draw more than 100 German
divisions, is for Britain and Amer
ica to make tremendous production
and transportation strides.
So They Say
With the consent and enthusiasm
of the British people, the demo
cratic country of Great Britain,
with a free press and free Parlia
ment. has achieved a totalitarianism
not far short of Germany.
—-A. Beverly Baxter, member of
Parliament.
The role Roosevelt covets is not
that of war leader but that of
peacemaker. I believe he believes
himself destined to be the maker
of a democratic peace.
—Anne O'Hare McCormick, the
New York Times.
Enslaved workers the world over
look to their American brothers for
the production of the weapons
which will make them free again.
—President Roosevelt to the CIO.
It is a sad commentary on Ameri
can life today that women are go
ing into every other kind of occupa
tion but household employment.

Famous Sayings
Fear has many eyes,—Cervantes.
by Paul Harrison . . .
Hollywood's Fads. Fancies and Foibles
By JOE GOTTEN
Actor for Mercury Productions
and Today's Guest Columnist for
Paul Harrison.
HOLLYWOOD, Dec. I.—For my
first—and probably last—attempt at
public writing with the Cotten chin.
So my topic for today is ""What's
Wrong With Hollywood.'’ This is
not to be confused with the other
subject that everyone picks: ' What's
Wrong With the Movies."" About
that I know nothing.
Hollywood is not what it ap
pears from the magazines. This is a
blow from which few actors ever
recover Cotten included. For one
thing, when I came to Hollywood
I had a good pari safely snagged.
Hundreds of others I found, have
had an equally easy time. That
wrecked notion No. 1: that to be
successful in the land of the movie,
you had to cadge beans for months.
Then came the glamor business.
Glamor must be here, because ali
the gossip columns say so. but it's
elusive. Sadly I write that glamor
as a positive quantity can be dis
covered just as easly in Keokuk
or New Bedford.
FRONT YARD FRAMER
My introduction to this tinseled
land startled me to death. I drove
in from New' York and started out
to find the house which had been
rented for me. To reach same, I
must cruise down Sunset boulevard.
On reaching that part of Los An
geles which is Hollywood, my sup- j
posedly sophisticated eye met noth
ing but a succession of enormous
and I mean enormous—photo por- i
traits framed. These reposed, and;
still do, on what seems to be every
front lawn of every other Imuse ior
about two miles along the boulevard.
It occurred to me that this was cer
tainly a novel way of attracting at
tention to your potential worth as
an actor or actress. It was a week
before I learned they were profes
sional portrait studios.
Arriving at the house picked for
me it was time for bed. So con
sider the shattering discovery of
the morning: NO swimming pool:
I thought everyone in the movie
business had a swimming pool. My
only solace is that I don't par
ticularly want one.
This all happened when Orsen
Welles was producing a number
called ""Citizen Kane."" I was cast
as Jed Leland. The morning alter
getting here, I rushed to the studio
full of fire, ambition, and most of
all. curiosity. A studio! Oh boy!
bv Willis Thornton ...
The Price of Freedom
Scarcely a heart in America but
was sick when reason failed and
the captive nunc controversy came
to a strike instead of peaceable
adjustment. Scarcely a heart but
is sick to read of men shot down
in bitter clashes that followed.
As we writhe, we mutter to our
selves “Why doesn't somebody DO
something?"" ""Why is this sort of
thing permitted'.’""
Six or seven years ago a certain
young German in this country was
surveying the strike situation, read
ing of the bitterness and disorder.
He tossed it all in our face with
a triumphant grin: ""You sec? This
sort of thing is not permitted in
Germany.""
Wc answered. “No. But bad as
it is, we believe here that it is ali
a part of the price of freedom
and that it is worth the price. The
words came back to us, reading the
(urrent news of the mine dis
turbances. They are still true words.
Certainly it would have been bet
ter had John Lewis seen the light
earlier, and agreed to arbitration
before BO 000 tons of steel produc
tion were irrevocably lost. Certainly
the time must come, and the sooner
the better when the I want what
I want when I want it"" attitude
in all men wedding a powerful in
fluence on the genera! welfare must
yield to a sense of proportion, a
broad view of the whole people's
necessities. But in the meantime
The president was patient, long
Lush, ylush settings, thousands of
beautiful girls parading around, a
sort of Arabian Nights in modern
dress. And what happened? Col
lapse. They started plastering me
with rubber cement and two weeks
later I managed to get myself in
front of a camera playing a man of
80.
SOI'NDS LIKE FI N
After ""Citizen Kane."" I played op
posite Merle Oberon in “Lydia"" and
by that time I was getting wise. I
had learned tue sad .act that they
make movies in exactly the same
fashion they make anything else.
You go to work at 8 and you quit
at 6 or 7 in me evening and then
you go home and eat.
Now I'm in “The Magnificent
Ambersons "" produced and directed
by Welles. He happens to be the
most unHollywcocien young man 1
ever met here—except that I met
him in New York. He would, if he
could, upset all of Hollywood’s tra
ditions. He would have the wild
harum-scarum night life, tne swim
mine pools, the jillions of gorgeous
gals, the fantastic parties I read
about. Unfortunately. Orson Orson
also is disillusioned. He goes to
bed at 11 p. m„ and is at work in
the studio at 7 a. m.
But my spells of disappointment
in the movie village don t last long.
I always remember the time when
I was a paint salesman.

the miners and to Lewis every inch
of their democratic rights in the
face of what most of the country
believes to have been a misuse of
those rights.
Other people have rights, too, and
it is their right to be assured that

ricious exercise of technical right.;

The ""easy solution, cn the face
