"massachusetts spy, and worcester county advertiser.",['Worcester'],1826-03-29,"The Constitution of this House; of the other House;
of the Judiciary ; the power of Congress over ques
tions ot Internal Improvement; the power of acquir
ing and governing territory, without limitation, be
yond the bounds of the United States; these are far
more important than the mollification of the election
of President; and if I believed the power of amend
ment was unrestricted, I would much sooner discuss,
vfor days and weeks, amendments to the Constitution,
that should touch some of these questions, wherein
the great intstcsts and industry of the country are
■wrapped Up, than those which we have now in hand.
Sir, I take the error to be, that of confounding what
is of importance to the individual citizen, with what
»S important to the people at large. To the individ
ual citizen, to the few prominent political leaders,
■whose talents and services place the office of Presi
dent within the reach of a laudable and well-regulat
ed ambition, it is unquestionably a subject of the
g eatest importance. To them, it is a question neither
-Uiore or less interesting, than whether they shall at
tain the highest honor, which this, or any other coun
try, in this or any other age, ever did, or can afford.
But is this the light in which the office is presented
to he majority of the people? No—the Constitution
of th Unit'd States has given no powers to the
President, depending on the modification of the elec
toral choice, by which he can be made dangerous to
the liberties of the country. Do not mistake me,
sir, I do not say, hi cause 1 do not think, that we may
not have a President dangerous to the liberties of the
peapie, dangerous to the purity of the Constitution.
But if we ever have such a President, it will he un
der circumstances disconnected from the modifica
tion of the existing Constitution, relative to the elec
toral choice. A dangerous President, depend on it,
will he chosen by an overwhelming majority. I
thought that the honorable mover of the lesolutions
was in a great mistake in this part of his argument,
where he maintained that in proportion as the Presi
dent was deficient in popular strength, his adminis
tratiou would be ominous to the wcl are of the peo
ple, within reasonable limits. 1 hold the direct con
trary to be true ; and that the event, the most omin
ous to this Constitution and to the liberties of this
people, would be, after a contested election, the tri
umph of a well-oiganized. embittered, and exasperat
ed majority. A dangerous President will be a stron""
President; and a strong President, to make him un
duly so, must be backed by a strong majority in this
House, aud a strong majority of the people.

PANAMA BCISSXOK.
WASHINGTON, MARCH 18, 1826.
The following Message from the President of the
United States was yesterday communicated to the
Mouse of Representatives:—
To the House of Representatives of the United States.
WASHINGTON, 15tll MARCH, 1826.
IN compliance with the resolution of the House of
the 6th ult. requesting me to cause to be laid before
the House so much of the correspondence between
the United States and the new States of America or
their Ministers, respecting the proposed Congress, or
meeting of diplomatic Agents at Panama, and such in
formation respecting the genera) character of that ex
pected Congress as may be in my possession, and as
may iu my opinion he communicated without preju
dice to the public interest; and also to inform the
Mouse so far as, in my opinion, the public interest
•may allow, in regard to what objects the Agents of the
United States are expected to take part in the delib
erations of that Congress; I now transmit to the House
a report from the Secretary of State, with the corres
pondence and information requested by the resolution.
With regard to the objects in which the Agents of
the United States are expected to take part ii> the de
liberations of that Congress, I deetn it proper to pre
mise, that these objects did not form the only, nor even
the principal motive for my acceptance of the invita
tion. My first and greatest inducement was, to meet,
in the spirit of kindness and friendship, an overture
made in that spirit by three sister Republics of this
hemisphere.
The great revolution in human affairs which has
brought into existence nearly at the same time eight
sovereign and independent nations in our own quarter
of (he globe, has placed the United States in a situa
tion not less novel, and scarcely less interesting, than
that iu which they had found themselves by their own
transition from a cluster of colonies to a nation of sove
reign States, 'i he deliverance of the Southern Ameri
can Republics from the oppression under which they
had been so long afflicted, was hailed with great una
nimity by the penpie of this Union, as among the most
auspicious events of the age. On the 4th of May,
1822, an Act of Congress made an appropriation of
one hundred thousand dollars for such missions to the
independent nations on the American continent as the
President of the United States might deetn proper.
In exercising the authority recognized by this Act.
my predecessor, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, appointed, successively, Ministers Ple
nipotentiary to the Republics of Colombia, Buenos
Ayres, Chili, and Mexico. Unwilling to raise among
the fraternity of freedom questions of precedency and
etiquette, which even the European monarchs had of
•late found it necessary in a great measure to discard,
he despatched these Ministers to Colombia, Buenos
Ayres, without exacting from those Repub
lics, as by the ancient principles of political primogen
iture he might have done, that the compliment of a
Plenipotentiary Mission should have been paid first by
them to the United States.
The instructions prepared under his direction to Mr.
Anderson, the first of our Ministers to the Southern
continent, contain at much length the general princi
ples upon which he thought it desirable that our rela
tions, political and commercial, with these our new
neighbours, should be established for their benefit aod
ours, and that of the future ages of our posterity. A
copy of so much of these instructions as relates to
these general subjects is amoog the papers now trans
mitted to the House.’ Similar instructions were fur
nished to the Ministers appointed to Buenos Ayres,
Chili, and Mexico ; and the system of social inter
course which it was the purpose of those missions to
establish from the first opening of our diplomatic
lations with those rising nations, is the most effective
exposition of the principles upon which the invitation
to the Congress of Panama has been accepted by me,
jas well as of the objects of negociation at that meet
ing, in which it was expected that our Plenipotentia
ries should take part.
The House will perceive that even at the date of
these instructions, the first treaties between some of
■the Southern Republics had been concluded, by which
they had stipulated among themselves this diplomatic
assembly at Panama. And it will be seen with what
caution, so far as it might concern the policy of the
United States, and st the same time with what frank
ness and good will towards those nations, he gave
countenance to their design of inviting the United
States to this high assembly, for consultation upon .4-
merican interest!. It was not considered a conclusive
mann fnr declining’ this invitation, that the proposal
of assembling such a Congress had not first been made
by ourselves. It had sprung from the urgent, imme
diate, and momentary common interests of the great
communities struggling for independence, and, as it
were, quickening into life. From them, the proposi
tion to us appeared respectful and friendly ; from us
to them it could scarcely have been made, without
exposing ourselves to suspicions of purposes of ambi
tion, if not of domination, more suited to rouse resist
ance and excite distrust, than to conciliate favour and
friendship. The first and paramount principle upon
which it was deemed wise and just to lay the corner-
Stone of all our future relations with them was disin
terestedness : the next was cordial good-will to them ;
the third was a claim of fair aud equal reciprocity.
Undr-r these impressions, when the invitation was for
mally aud earnestly given, had it even been doubtful
am >■ the objects proposed for consideration
and discussion at the Congress were such as that im-
mediate and important interests of the United States
would be affected by the issue, I should nevertheless
have determined, so far as it depended upon me, to
have accepted the invitation, and to have appointed
Ministers to attend the meeting. The proposal itself
implied that the Republics by whom it was made, be-
Hered that important interests of ours, or of theirs, ren
dered our attendance there desirable. They had giv
en us notice that, in the novelty of their situation, and
in the spirit of deference to our experience, they would
be pleased to have the benefit of our friendly counsel.
To meet the temper with which this proposal was
made with a cold repulse, was not thought congenial
to that warm interest in their welfare, with which the
People and Government of the Union had hitherto
gone hand in hand through the whole progress of their
revolution. To insult them by a refusal of their over
ture, and then inviting them to a similar assembly, to
be called by ourselves, was an expedient which never
presented itself to the mind. 1 would have sent Min
isters to the meeting, bad it been merely to give them
such advice as they might have desired even with ref
erence to their own interests, not involving ours. 1
would have sent them, had it been merely to explain
and set forth to them .our reasons for declining any
proposal of specific measures to w hich they might de
sire our concurrence, but which we might deem in
compatible with our interests or our duties. In the
intercourse betw'een nations, Temper is a missionary
perhaps more powerful than talent. Nothing was ev
er lost by kind treatment—nothing can be gained by
sullen repulses and aspiring pretensions.
But objects of the highest importance, not only to
the future welfare of the whole human race, but bear
ing directly upon the special interests of this Union,
icill engage the deliberations of the Congress of Pana
ma, whether we arc represented there or not. Others,
if we are represented, may be offered by our Plenipo
tentiaries for consideration, having in view both those
great results, our own interests, and the improvement
of the condition of man upon earth. It may be, that
in the lapse of many centuries, no other opportunity
so favourable will be presented to the Government of
the United States, to subserve the benevolent purposes
of Divine Providence—to dispense the promised bles
sings of the Redeemer of mankind—to promote the
pievaience, in future ages, of Peace on Eaith, and
Good Will to Man,-as will now be placed in their
power, by participating in the deliberations of this
Congress.
Among the topics enumerated in official papers,
published by the Republic of Colombia, and adverted
to in the correspondence now communicated to the
House, as intended to be presented for discussion at
Panama, there is scarcely one in which .the result vt
the meeting will not deeply affect the interests of the
United States, Even those in which the Belligerent
States alone will take an active pait, will Trave a
powerful effect upon the state of our relations with
the American, and probably with the principal Euro- '
pean States. Were it merely that we might be cor- 1
rectly and speedily informed of the proceedings of
the Congress, and of the progress and issue oi their
negotiations, I should hold it advisable that we should
have an accredited agency with them, placed in such
confidential relations with the other members as would
ensure the authenticity and the safe and early trans
mission of its Reports.
I Ofthe same enumerated topics, are the preparation
of a Manifesto, setting forth to the world tjie justice
of their cause, and the relations they desire to hold
with other Christian Powers; and to form a Conven
tion ot Navigation and’Commerce, applicable both to
the Confederated States and their Allies.
It will be within the recollection of the House,
that, immediately after the close of the War of our In
dependence, a measure, closely analogous to this Con
gress of Panama, was adopted by the Congress of our
Confederation, and for purposes of precisely the same
character. I hree Commissioners, with Plenipotentiary
powers, were appointed to negotiate Treaties of Ami
ty, Navigation and Commerce, with all the principal
powers of Europe. They met, and resided for that
purpose about one year at Paris ; and the only result
of their negotiations at that time, was the first Treaty
between the United States and Prussia, memorable in
the diplomatic annals of the world, and precious as a
monument of the principles, in relation to Commerce '
and Maritime M arfare, with which our countiy enter- I
ed upon her career, as a member of the great family
of independent nations. This Treaty, prepared in ‘
conformity with the instructions of the American '
Plenipotentiaries, consecrated three fundamental prin
ciples of the foreign intercourse which the Congress
of that period were desirous of establishing. First,
equal reciprocity and the mutual stipulation of the
privileges of the most favoured nation, in the com
mercial exchanges of Peace. Secondly, the abolition
of private war upon the ocean ; and, thirdly, restric
tions favourable to Neutral Commerce, upon Bellig
erent practices, with regard to contraband ol war, ami
blockades. A painful—it may be said a calamitous
experience, of more years, has demonstrat
ed the deep importance of these principles to
the peace and prosperity of this nation, and to the
welfare of all Maritime States, and lias illustrated the
profound wisdom with which they were assumed as
cardinal points of the policy of the Union.
At thattime, in the infancy of their political exist
ence, under the influence of those principles of liber
ty and of right, so congenial to the cause in which
they had just fought and triumphed, they were able
but to obtain the sanction of one great and philosoph
ical, though absolute sovereign of Europe, to their
liberal and enlightened principles. They could ob
tain no more. Since then, apolitical hurricane has
gone over three-fourths ofthe civilized portions of the
earth; the desolation of which, it may with confi
dence be expected, is passing away, leaving at least
the American atmosphere purified and refreshed.
And now, at this propitious moment, the new-born
nations of this hemisphere, assembling, by their Rep
resentatives, at the Isthmus, between its two Conti
nents, to settle the principles of their future interna
tional intercourse with other nations, and with us :—
ask, in this great exigency, for our advice, upon those
very fundamental maxims, which we, from our cradle,
had first proclaimed, and partially succeeded to intro
duce into the code of National Law.
Without recurring to that total prostration of all
neutral and commercial rights, which marked the
progress of the late European wars, and which final-
Jy involved the United States in them ; and, adverting
only to our political relations with these American na
tions, it is observable, that, while, in all other re
spects, those relations have been uniformly, and with
out exception, of the most friendly and mutually
satisfactory character; the only causes of difference
and dissension between us and them which ever have
arisen, originated in those never-failing fountains of
discord and irritation, discriminations of commercial
favour towards other nations, licentious privateers,
and paper blockades. I cannot, without doing injus
tice to the Republics of Buenos Ayres and Colombia,
forbear to acknowledge the candid and conciliatory
spirit, with which they have repeatedly yielded to
our friendly representations and remonstrances on
these subjects—in repealing discriminative laws,
which operated to our disadvantage, and in revoking
the commissions of their privateers—to which Colom
bia has added the magnanimity of making reparation
tor unlawful captures by some of her cruisers, and of
assenting, in the midst of war, to Treaty stipulations,
favourable to neutral navigation. But the recurrence
of these occasions of complaint has rendered the re
newal of the discussions which result in the removal
of them necessary, while, in the mean time, injuries
are sustained by merchants and other individuals of
the United States, which cannot be repaired, and the
remedy lingers in overtaking the pernicious operation
of the mischief. The settlement of general principles,
pervading with equal efficacy all the American States,
can alone put an end to these evils, and can alone be
accomplished at the proposed Assembly.
If it be true that the noblest treaty of peace ever
mentioned in history, is that by which the Carthage
nians were bound to abolish the practice of sacrificing
their own children, because it was stipulated in favour
of human nature, I cannot exaggerate to myself the
unfading glory with which these United States will go
forth in the memory of future ages, if, by their friend-
MagmrhusHtg
ly counsel, by their moral influence, by the power of
argument and persuasion, alone, they can prevail up
on the American Nations al Panama to stipulate, by
general agreement among themselves, and so far as
any of them may be concerned, the perpetual aboli
tion of private war upon the ocean. And if we can
not yet flatter ourselves that this may be accomplish
ed, as advances towards it, the establishment of the
principle that the friendly flag shall cover the cargo,
the curtailment of contraband of war, and the pro
scription of fictitious paper blockades, engagements
which, we may reasonably h»pe, will not prove im
practicable, will, if successfully inculcated, redound
proportionally to our honour, and drain the fountain
of many a future war.
The late President of the United States/ in his
message to Congress, of the 2d of Dec. 1823, while
announcing the negotiation then pending with Russia,
relating to the North-West Coast of this continent,
observed that the occasion of the discussions, to which
that incident had given rise, had been taken, “ for as
serting as a principle, in which the rights and inte
rests of the United States were involved, that the
American continents, by the free and independent
condition which they had assumed and maintained,
were thenceforward not to be considered as subjects
for future colonization by any European power.”
'1 he principle bad first been assumed in that negotia
tion with Russia. It rested upen a course of reason
ing equally simple and conclusive. With the excep
tion ot the existing Europe an Colonies, which it was
in no wise intended to disturb, the two continents con
sisted of several sovereign ana independent nations,
whose territories covered their whole surface. By
this their independent condition, the United Ststes en
joyed the right of commercial intercourse with every j
part of their possessions. To attempt the establish
ment oi a colony in those possessions, would be to
usurp, to the exclusion of others, a commercial inter
course which was the common possession of all. It
could not be done without encroaching upon existing
rights of the United States. The Government of
Russia has never disputed these positions, nor mani
fested the slightest dissatisfaction at their having I
been taken. Most of the new American Republics j
have declared their entire assent to them, and they
now propose, among the subjects of consultation at ।
Panama, to take into consideration the means of mak-1
ing effectual the assertion of that principle, as well
as the means of resisting interference fiom abroad,
with the domestic concerns of the American Govern
ments.
In alluding to these means, it would be obviously
premature, nt this time, to anticipate tnat which is
offered merely as a matter for consultation ; or to pro
nounce upon those measures w hich have been or may
be suggested. The purpose of this government is to
concur in none which would import hostility to Eu
rope, or justly excite resentaient in any of her States.
Should it be deemed advisable to,contract any con
ventional engagement on this topic, our views would
extend no further than to a mutual pledge of the par
ties to the compact to maistam the principle in ap
plication to its own territoiy, and to permit no colo
nial lodgments or establishments, of European juris
diction, upon its own soil: and with respect to the
obtrusive interference from abroad, if its future char
acter may be inferred from that which has been, and,
perhaps, still is, exercised in more than one of the
new States, a joint declaration cf its character, and
exposure of it to the world, may be probably all that
the occasion would require. Whether the United
States should or should not be parties to such a decla
ration, may justly form a part of the deliberation.—
That there is an evil to be remedied, needs little in
sight into the secret history of late years to know ;
and that this remedy may best he concerted at the
Panama meeting, deserves at least the experiment ol
consideration.
A concert of measures having reference to the more
effectual abolition ofthe African slave-trade, and the
consideration of the light in which the political con
dition of the island of Hayti is to be regarded, are al
so among the subjects mentioned by the Minister
from the Republic of Colombia, as believed to be suit
able for deliberations at the Congress. The failure '
of the negotiations with that Republic, undertaken '
during the late administration, for the suppression of
that trade, in compliance with a resolution of the ;
House of Representatives, indicates the expediency I
of listening with respectful attention to propositions I
which may contribute to the accomplishment of the
great end which was the purpose of that resolution, 1
while the result of those negotiations will serve as ad
monition to abstain from pledging this Government to
any airangement which might be expected to fail of
obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate, by a
constitutional majority, to its ratification.
Whether the political condition of the island of
Hayti, shall be brought at all into discussion at the
meeting, may be a question for preliminary advise
ment. There are in the political constitution of gov
ernment of that people, circumstances which have
hitherto forbidden the acknowledgment of them by
the Government of the United States as sovereign and
independent. Additional reasons for withholding
that acknowledgment have recently been seen in
their acceptance of a nominal sovereignty by the grant
of a foreign Prince, under conditions equivalent to the
concession by them of exclusive commercial advan
tages to one nation, adapted altogether to the state
of colonial vassalage, and retaining little of independ
ence but the name. Our Plenipotentiaries will be in
structed to present these views to the assembly at
Panama ; and should they not be concurred in. to
decline acceding to any arrangement which may be
proposed on different principles.
The condition of the islands of Cuba and Porto Ri
co, is of deeper import, and more immediate bearing
upon the present interests and future prospects of our
Union. The correspondence herewith transmitted
will show how earnestly it has engaged the attention
of this Government. The invasion of both the islands
by those united forces of Mexico and Colombia, is
avowedly among the objects to be matured by the
belligerent States at Panama. The convulsions to
which, from the peculiar composition of their popula
tion, they would be liable in the event of such an in
vasion, and the danger therefrom resulting, of their
falling ultimately into the hands of some European
pow*er, other than Spain, will not admit of our looking
at the consequences to which the Congress at Pana
ma may lead, with indifference. It is unnecessary to
enlarge upon this topic, or to say more than that all
our efforts in reference to this interest will be to pre
serve the existing state of things; the tranquillity of
the islands, and the peace and security of their in
habitants.
And lastly, the Congress of Panama is believed to
present a fair occasion for urging upon all the new
nations of the South the just and liberal principles of
Religious Liberty, not by any interference whatever
in their internal concerns, but by claiming for our cit
izens, w hose occupations or interests may call them to
occasional residence in their'territories, the inestima
ble privilege of worshipping their Creator according to
the dictates ol their own consciences. This privilege,
sanctioned by the cuslomary Law of Nations, and se
cured by Treaty stipulations, in numerous national
compacts ; secured even to our own citizens in the
treaties with Colombia, and with the Federation of
Central America, is yet to be obtained in the other
South American States, and Mexico. Existing prej
udices are still struggling against it, which may, per
haps, be more successfully combated at this general
meeting, than al the separate seats of government of
each Republic.
I can scarcely deem it otherwise than superfluous,
to observe, that the assembly will be, in its nature,
Diplomatic, and not Legislative: that nothing fan be
transacted there obligatory upon any one of the States
to be represented at the meeting, unless with the ex
press concurrence of its own Representatives, nor
even then, but subject to the ratification of its con
stitutional authority at home. The faith of the Uni
ted States to foreign Powers, cannot otherwise be
pledged. I shall, indeed, in the first place, consider
the assembly as merely consultative ; and although
the Plenipotentiaries of the United States will be em
powered to receive arid refer to the consideration of
their Government any proposition from the other par-
ties to the meeting, they will be authorized to con
clude nothing unless subject to the definitive sanction
of this Government in all its constitutional forms. It
has, therefore, seemed to me unnecessary to insist
that every object to be discussed at the meeting should
be specified with the precision of a judicial sentence,
or enumerated with the exactness of a mathematical
demonstration. The purpose of the meeting itself, is
to deliberate upon the great and common interests of
several new and neighbouring nations. If the meas
ure is new, and without precedent, so is the situation
of the parties to it. '1 hat the purposes of the meeting
are somewhat indefinite, far from being an objection
to it, is among the cogent reasons for its'adoption. It
is . not the establishment oi principles of intercourse
with one, but with seven or eight nations at once.—
I hat, before they have had the means of exchanging
ideas, and of communicating with one another, in
common, upon these topics, they should have defini
tively settled and arranged them in concert, is to re
quire that the effect should precede the cause : it is
to exact, as a preliminary to the meeting, that for the
accomplishment of which the meeting itself is design
ed.
Among the inquiries which were thought entitled
to consideration, before the determination was taken
to accept the invitation, was. that whether the meas
ure might not have a tendency to change the policy*
hitherto invariably pursued by the United States, of
avoiding all entangling alliances, and all unnecessary
foreign connexions.
Mindful of the advice given by the father of our
country in his farewell address', that the great rule of
conduct for us in regard to foreign nations, is, in ex
tending our commercial relations, to have with them
as little political connexion as possible ; and faithful
ly adhering to the spirit of that admonition, I cannot
overlook the reflection, that the counsel of Washing
ton, in this instance, like all the counsels of wisdom,
was founded upon the circumstances in which our
country, and the world around us, were situated at
the time when it was given. That the reasons as
signed by him for bis advice were, that Europe had a
set of primary interests, which to us had none or a
very remote relation. That hence she must be en
gaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which
wire essentially foreign to our concerns. That our
detached and distant situation invited and enabled
us to pursue a different course. That by our union
and rapid growth, with an efficient Government, the
period was not far distant when we might defy mate
rial injury from external annoyance ; when we might
take such an attito'i® -• w»..ij —..— --. ..^ u n«niy
to be respected ; and, with reference to belligerent
nations, might choose peace or war, as our interest,
guided by justice, should counsel.
Compare our situation and the circumstances of
that time with those of the present day, and what,
from the very words of XV ashington then, would be
his counsels to his countrymen now ? Europe has
still her set of primary interests, with which we have
little or a remote relation. Our distant and detached
situation, with reference to Europe, remains the
same. But we w*ere then the only independent na
tion of this hemisphere, and we w< re surrounded by
European colonies, with the greater part of which
we had no more intercourse than with the inhabitants
of another planet. Those colonies have now been
transformed into eight independent nations, extend
ing to our very borders ; seven of them Republics
like ourselves; with whom we have an immensely
growing commercial, and must have, and have al
ready, important political connexions ; with reference
to whom, our situation is neither distant nor detach
ed ; whose political principles and systems of gov
ernment, congenial with our own, must and will
have an action and counteraction upon us and ours,
to which we cannot he indifferent if we would. The
rapidity of one growth, and the consequent increase
of our strength, has more than realized the anticipa
tions of this admirable political legacy. Thirty years
have nearly elapsed since it was written, and in the
interval, our population, our wealth, our territorial
extension, our power, physical and moral, has nearly
। trebled. Reasoning upon this state of things, from
the sound and judicious principles ol Washington,
and must we not say, that the period which he pre
dicted as then not far off, has arrived ? That Amer
ica has a set of primary interests, which have none,
or a remote, relation to Europe. That the interfer
ence of Europe, therefore, in those concerns, should
be spontaneously withheld by her upon the same
principle that we have never interfered with hers ;
and that if she. should interfere, as she may, by
measures which may have a great and dangerous re
coil upon ourselves, we might be called, in defence of
■ our own altars and firesides, to take an attitude which
I would cause our neutrality to be respected, and
choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by jus
; tice, shall counsel.
Ths acceptance of this invitation, therefore, far
from conflicting with the counsel or the policy of Wash
ington, is directly deducible from, and conformable
to it. Nor is it less conformable to the views of my
immediate predecessor, as declared in his annua!
message to Congress, of the 2d of December, 1823,
to which I have already adverted, and to an impor
tant passage of which I invite the attention of the
House.—“ The citizens of the United States,” said
he, “ cherish sentiments the most friendly in favour
of the liberty and happiness of their fellow-men on
that (the European) side of the Atlantic. In the
wars of the European powers, in matters relating to
themselves, we have never taken any part, nor does
it comport within our policy so to do. It is only when
our rights are invaded, or seriously menaced, that we
resent injuries, or make preparation for our defence.
With the movements in this hemisphere, we are, of
necessity, more immediately connected, and by caus
es which must be obvious to all enlightened and im
partial observers. The political system of the Allied
Powers is essentially different, in this respect, from
that of America. This difference proceeds from that
which exists in their respective governments—and to
the defence of our own, which has been achieved by
the loss of so much blood and treasure, and matured
by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and
under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity,
this whole nation is devoted. We owe it, therefore,
to candour, and to the amicable relations subsisting
between the United States and those powers, to de
clare, that we should consider any attempt on their
part to extend their system to any poition of this
hemisphere, as dangerous to our peace and safety.—
With the existing colonies or dependencies of any
European power, we have not interfered, and shall
not interfere. But with the Governments who have
declared their independence, and maintained it, and
whose independence we have, on great consideration,
and on just principles acknowledged, we could not
view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing
them, or controlling in any other manner their des
tiny, by any European power, in any other light than
as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition to
wards the United States. In the war between those
new Governments and Spain, wo declared our neu
trality at the time of our recognition, and to this we
have adhered, and shall continue to adhere, provided
no change shall occur, which, in the judgment of the
competent authorities of this Government, shall make
a corresponding change on the part of the United
States indispensable to their security.”
To the question which may be asked, whether this
meeting, and the principles which may be adjusted
and settled by it, as rules of intercourse between the
American nations, may not give umbrage to the Holy
League of European powers, or offence to Spain, it is
deemed a sufficient answer, that our attendance at
Panama can give no just cause of umbrage or offence
to either; and that the United States will stipulate
nothing there which can give such cause. Here the
right of inquiry into our purposes and measures must
stop. The Holy League of Europe itself was formed
without inquiring of the United States whether it
would or would not give umbrage to them. The
fear of giving umbrage to the Holy League of Europe
was urged* as a motive for denying to the American
nations the acknowledgment of their independence.
That it would be viewed by Spain as hostility to her,
was not only urged, but directly declared by herself.
The Congress and Administration of that day cou-
suited their rights and duties, and not their fears, fully determined to
give no needless displeasure to any foreign power, the United
States can estimate the probability of their giving it only the
by which any foreign State could have to take it from their
measures. Neither the representation of the United States at Ta
naina, nor any measure to which their assent may be yielded there
will give to the Holy League, or any of its members, nor to Spain’
the right to take offence. Eor the rest, the United States must still’
as heretofore, take counsel from their duties rather than their fears. ’
Such are the objects in which it is expected that the Plenipoten
tiaries of the United States, when commissioned to attend the meet
ing at the Isthmus, will take part; and such are the motives and
purposes with which the invitation of the three Republics was ac
cepted. It was, however, as the House will perceive from the
correspondence, accepted only upon condition that the nomination
of Commissioners for the Mission should receive the advice and
consent of the Senate. The concurrence of the House to the meas
ure, by the appropriations necessary for carrying it into effect, is
alike subject to its free determination, and indispensable to the ful
filment of the intention.
That the Congress at Panama will accomplish all, or even any
of the transcendant benefits to the human race, which warmed
the conceptions of its first proposer, it were, perhaps, indulging too
sanguine a forecast of events to promise. It is, in its nature, a
measure speculative and experimental. The blessing of Reaven
may turn it to the account of human improvement. Accidents un
foreseen, and mischances not to be anticipated, may baffle all its
high purposes, and disappoint its fairest expectations. But the de
sign is great, is benevolent, is humane. It looks to the meliora
tion of the condition of man. It is congenial with that spirit which
prompted our Declaration of Independence ; which inspired the
preamble to our first treat}* with France ; which dictated our first
treaty with Prussia, and the instructions under which it was nego
tiated ; which filled the hearts, and fired the souls of the immortal
founders of our Revolution.
With this unrestricted exposition of the motives by which 1 have
been governed in this transaction, as well as of the objects to
be discussed, and of the ends, if possible, to be attained by our
representation at the proposed Congress, I submit the propriety of
an appropriation to the candid consideration and enlightened patri
otism of the Legislature.

LATEST FROM EUROPE.
By an arrival from Havre, we have received Paris pa
pers to the 30th, including London dates to the 2Gth J<>""
“""•J-
Every thing was quiet in Russia, and there was no rea
son to anticipate any civil disturbances.
It is said that Count Nesselrode, the Russian Prime
Minister, had addressed a note to the other Christian cab
inets, stating that his government had presented energetic
remonstrances to the Porte relative to the evacuation of
Moldavia and Wallachia, and requesting the other powers
to join with the Russian Cabinet in promptly terminat
ing that affair.
A London paper of the 24rh January says : “ The Am
bassador of France, anil the Minister of the United States
had a conference with Mr. Canning yesterday. The.
same day Ihe honorable Secretary of State a Idressed a let
ter to the Russian Minister.”
PARIS, JANUARY 25.
It is said that agents have been appointed by the gov
ernment to reside in Mexico, Pern and Colombia ; but
they are to have no public and avowed character. They
are intended to guard the commercial interests of France ;
but are not to be called or known as either consuls or
agents.
The G.izette of Munich asserts that the papers found
on the person arrested at St. Petersburg, in conse
quence of the revolt of (he 26th December, leave no
doubt of their intention to re-act in Russia the scenes of
Cadiz, Naples and Turin. The conspirators bad, it
seems, previously resolved the death of Alexander.
VIENNA, DEC. 11.
The news of the sending of Turkish Plenipotentia
ries to the Morea, has caused great sensation here. A
letter from Constantinople, which we received by the last
mail from Bucharest, affirms, that the representations of
some Foreign Ambassadors have induced the Port to send
negociators to the head-quarters of Ibrahim Pacha, to
treat with the Greek Chiefs for a suspension or rather a
cessation of hostilities. But other accounts, from more
authentic sources, affirm, that the Foreign Ministers alone
could never have induced the Porte to take such a step;
it must be attributed to the representations of Ibrahim
Pacha, and of his father. It is affirmed, that the Porte
which some time ago guaranteed to Ibrahim Pacha five
general government of Greece, is unwilling to confine
Itself to the military possession of the fortresses, and to
ffive to each of the Greek fortresses promises of a Lieut.
Governor, chosen among the inhabitants, leaving those
functionaries dependant on Ibrahim Pacha. These places
will be conferred on the principal Greek Chiefs, if thev
readily submit. There is a great deal said about propo
sals already made on this subject, which it is affirmed, at
least at Constantinople, have been well received by some
Military Chiefs.
The Missolonghi Gazette of the 2d December, was re
ceived in London. At that time the place was free from
blockade.
Letters from Smyrna of the 27th of December, and
from Corfu of the 31st January, announce an important
victory gained by the Greeks under the walls of Missi
longhi. Ibrahim Pacha having embarked a great part of
his troops at Patras for the siege of Missolonghi, the Hy
driotes and Spezziotes finding themselves no longer block
aded by the Ottoman fleet, promptly transported 7 to 8000
Romeliotes, who arrived before Missolonghi at the same
time as the Egyptians. The latter, surprised by this skil
ful manoeuvre, were completely routed. It is said they
lost 4000 men.
There was a grand assembly of the Divan at Constanti
nople on the 22d December, at which the ministers assist
ed. After the adjournment of the meeting, Couriers were
despatched to Egypt and the Morea, no doubt carrying
with them new instructions to the Commissioners, who
had set out to treat with the Greeks. The Greek Priests
had received orders to repair instantly to the Mussulman
Commissioners, inorder to induce the inhabitants of the
Morea to listen to their representations.
The official gazette of Madrid contains the following article in
the shape of affidavit: Miss Elizabeth Cano, born in 1786, of del
icate constitution, attained the age of 15 without serious indispo
sition ; in 1819 she was attacked with epileptic fits, which termi
nated in a deep sleep that lasted three months ; she recovered ttnd
enjoyed perfect health for several months, when she again fell a
sleep, which lasted several months; she’awoko, and continued in
good health until 1815, when she took a nap, which lasted until
September, 1825, ten years ! She lived, however, but six days af
ter she awoke, her frame being exhausted. She remembered per
sons from their voice. We have our doubts of the truth of this
story, though told by authority.
Horrible Circumstance.— A few days ago, a man died at Block
ley, in this county, ol small-pox; on the same day the body was
put into a coffin, and placed in the church-yard while the grave
was made ; some • liildren who stood near the coffin, thinking they
heard a groan, mentioned the circumstance to the grave-digger,
who,'however, look no notice of it, and the body was interred.
The children having talked o( what they had heard, attention was
excited, and on the following morning the body was taken up,
when, dreadful to relate, the torn state of the shroud left no doubt
that the poor wretch had been buried alive.

HOMEWARD BOUND.
On ’ on ! thou eagle pinion’d bark,
Haste on thy watery way ’
Thou’lt meet the tempest wild and dark
For many a weary day,
For many a day and many a night,
Thou’lt plough the billowy deep,
Or o’er the crested waves, in light
Majestic beauty sweep.
Spread, spread abroad thy glorious wings, •
And court each wandering breeze, *
That aye to meet thy wooing, springs,
Thou daughter of the seas !
They come! they come ! the wakening gales,
Their eager kiss 1 feel i
Lo! with their full tide swell thy sails,
And flies thy sparkling keel!
Onward ! thou gallant ship ! nor fear
The raving tempest's wrath—
Outbrave it all, and boldly steer
Right on thy homeward path .
I long to hear the Ocean’s foam
Dash on my native strand;
I long to breathe the gales that come
From my own father land !
I long to roam the verdant hills,
To climb the rock-built mountains;
I long to chase the sportive rills,
That bubble from the fountains;
For still, though years upon my brow
A manlier shade have flung,
My heart’s warm currents briskly flow,
Aad still my soul is young.
I long, oh ! how I long to see
The elm-o’ershadow’d cot;
Of all this clouded world, to me.
The only sunny spot.
My home ! how sweet the sound! my borne’.
Scene of my Eden hours —
Where Love, and Joy, and Pleasure bloom !
Life’s bright perennial flowers.
Earthquakes The Ogdensburg, N. Y., Re
publican of Jan. 24 says the shock of an earth
quake was felt al that place on Sunday night
previous at about half past 11 o'clock. Houses
were shaken so much as to awaken many from
sleep ; and the tremulous motion of every
thing was painfully perceptible to every person
awake. The rattling of stoves, crockery, and
windows, with the vibration of every thing
moveable, together with a sound like distant
thunder beneath the surface of the earth, was
distinctly witnessed by all who had not retired
to sleep. There were three distinct shocks,
the second being the most violent, at intervals
of about half a minute, and ths rumbling noise
continued two or three minutes.
The Montreal Courant of Jan. 25, says—A
slight shock of an earthquake was felt in that
city on Sunday night at the same hour. The
motion resembled the shaking of a steamboat
whose machinery agitates her much ; it con
tinued for about four seconds, and was accom
panied with an indistinct noise.
A letter dated Grenada, Dec. 4, says—“ We
have just experienced a most severe shock of
an earthquake; I suppose it lasted nearly half
a minute. The people were assembled in Church
and the shock was tremendous. I really think
the West Indies are a devoted country ; hurri
canes, sUmmw. tndearthquakes follow one an
other in continual succession.”
A*. Y. Com. Advertiser.
The Cholera. The Paris Journal des
Debats says, that the coachman of the
French Ambassador at St. Petersburg, hav
ing one day been-too liberal in his libations
to Bacchus, was found drunk and asleep in
one of the streets of that city, in the midst
of a great number of persons who had per
ished of the cholera. The persons whose :
occupation it was to inter the dead bodies, j
threw him among the rest into their cart, to I
bear !?. the place of sepulture. While ['
they were employed til Jibing a common I
pit, the coachman awoke, and was natural-I
ly very much frightened at finding himself
in such unpleasaut company. He soon re
cognized the nature of the disease of which
his livid companions had died, and almost
speechless with terror, he ran with all speed
to the embassy. This fellow, who remained
nearly five hours packed among a heap of
persons who had fallen victims to the cholera,
has not experienced the slightest symptom
of that fatal malady.
Slavery im Virginia. The debates in
the House of Delegates of Virginia upon
this subject, have been terminated by the
adoption of a preamble and resolution re
ported by the select committee, to whom
the memorials had been referred, with
amendments. The resolution as finally
adopted, declares that it is inexpedient to
make any legislative enactments at present,
for the abolition of Slavery ; but the pream
ble assigns the reason for this declaration,
by stating, that the removal of the free peo
ple of color, and of those who may become
free, will absorb all the present means of
the Stnte ; and that a further action for the
removal of the Slaves should await a more
definite development of public opinion.
Some of the warmest friends of abolition vot
ed in favor of the acceptance of the report.
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
Territory of Huron. A committee of the
House of Representatives have reported ■ bill
to organize a new Territorial Government over
that portion of the present Territory of Michi
gan, which lies west of Lake Michigan. It is
a country of vast extent, and much of it is rep
resented as fertde and inviting. In addition to
abundant and valuable Lead Mines of
Galena and Wisconsin, are included within its
limits The present population is estimated by
Mr Wing, delegate to Congress from Michi
gan, at about 7000.
It is staled in Ihe Hampshire Gazette that a
week or two since a person from that vicinity
found sheep so low at Brighton, that he pur
chased 800 and drove them home: he owned
2000 before.
An inexhaustible bed of limestone has been

It cannot escape notice that all Gen. Jack

of salaries. We hear of no proposed reduc

The Painful and Debilitating Complaint tj
THE FIXES I
RECEIVES immediate relief, and in
numerous instances, has been thoroughly
cured, by the administration ot Dumfries Remedy
Jor the Piles. Thia approved compound also
mitigates and removes the symptoms which fre
quently accompany that disorder, and increase
the danger of the patient, viz-; pains in Loins—
Headache—Loss of Appetite—lndigestion, and
other marks of debility.
A relieved Patient writes from a distance. “ It
is but justice lo you to inform you, that I have
used your Dumfries Remedy for the Piles, tor
sometime past,and have found it eminently sue
cessfal.”
An officer in the army observes, “ 1 have been
troubled for years with the Piles, and have never
found any remedy that would compare with yours.
It gave me almost Immediate relief”
A Physitian and Druggest writes, ‘*l have
sold all the medicine you sent me, which is so
highly recommended for the Piles. I wish you
to send me one dozen more by the bearer.”
The remedy is quite innocent, and may be
administered to all ages and both sexes. Plain
and ample directions, with a description of lh«
complaint, accompany each package, which con
sists of (wo boxes, one con lain ing an Ointment,
and the other an Electuary. Price $1 for both
articles, or 50 cents where but one is wanted.
Invaluable Remedy!
Tested by experience, and sustained by tes
timonials !
WW OST people have a remedy for Corns
IVJL .. well as other complain I s;—but the pro
prietor of the long known .nil justly celebrated
Albion Corn Plaster
(as prepared by the late Dr. Conway,) bas been
made acquainted with no instance of its proper
application, in which it has not been preferred to
all other Remedies for Cohns, those painful dis
figure rs of the feet, and enemies to locomotion
rhe Albion Corn Plaster softens the corn, how
ever old and tough, and extracts it to the very
roots. The relief afforded, is gentle, immediate,
and thorough The proprietor begs leave to sub
mit the following case, from Mr. Stowell, who is
well known as a very worthy and respectable citi
zen.
T. Kidder —l do not hesitate to give my
most unqualified approbation in favor of your val
uable Albion Corn Plaster. By the use of less
that a box, Mrs. Stowell has been cured of a corn
on each foot, which had been exceedingly trouble
sone and painful for years, and I think it but
justice to your invaluable preparation to add, that
your Plaster cured her corns alter trying other
highly recommended remedies to no purpose ;
and what increases my confidence in the superi
ority of your Plaster, is the fact, that it has been
used by several of my neighbors with equally good
success. A man advanced in years, had become
so crippled with corns, as to be obliged to cut
holes in his shoes to ease his feet, he had long
suffered great torture and inconvenience—lias
lately been entirely cured by the use ot your Corn
Plaster, so; that he can now walk with comfort,
and in whole shoes. A young woman living near
me, had become so lame in consequence of corns,
as not to be able to go up and down stairs with
out great trouble, is now using the Plaster with
the most happy success, and prospect of speedy
cure. 1 could refer to several other cases, were
it necessary, but I have seen enough of the Plas
ter to satisfy me it is the best preparation in this
country, for the cure of Corns; anil were its
virtues generally Vnown r 1 doubt whether you
could prepare the article fast enough lo meet
the public demand.

Dr. S. HE WES’s
Rheumatic, Nerve, and Bone
LINIMENT.
THE Proprietor, in offering this article
to the public, deems it not improper to
frankly acknowledge his motives, which are—
first, his own interest, and secondly, to relieve
those who are suffering under those diseases for
which this is designed. He is well aware that
there are many articles already before the publie
for such complaints, yet norae has ever been offered
which has given such immediate and permanent
relief. It was prescribed bv Dr. S. Hewes, dur
ing many years practice in Boston, and obtained
greater celebrity than any other article, and at
his death the recipe was left as a legacy to one of
, his connections, of whom it was purchased by the
present proprietor. It is not, therefore, a new
article, of doubtful efficacy, but hundreds, and
probably thousands, have been cured or relieved
by itsusc. The Proprietor states explicitly, that
it is nal “a cure for every thing,” but is confident
ly recommended in inflammatory, sciatic, anp
chronic rheumatism; it gives relief to the swelling
of the glands of the throat, and by promoting cir
culation, it relieves the numbness and contrac
tion of the limbs ; to bruises and sprains it gives
immediate relief; where bones have been frac
tured, itassUu aUaftishinglv in strengthening the
muscles, and to persons troubled with tempo
rary deafness, a few drops on sheep's wool* ap
plied to the ear, will afford relief.
RECOMMENDATIONS.
From the numerous certificates, which the
Proprietor hag received of its efficacy, he presents
the following:—
Billerica, 1830. To whom it may concern : I
certify that for some years past I have been afflict
ed with rheumatism, and having used many kinds
of medicine without effect at last I purchased one
bottle of Dr. Shubael Hewes’ Rheumatism, Nerve
and Bone Liniment,and by it was enabled in one
week’s time to go about my house without pain. 1
feel it a duty I owe to suffering humanity to let
the public know of its great value.
Josiah Stevens.
Boston, 18W. This may certify, that I have
used Dr. Shubael Hewes* celebrated Rheuma
tism, Nerve and Bone Liniment, for bruises and
sprains, and 1 can recommend it to be a very use
ful article for the public. Waiihen Thaxter
Hartford, (Conn) 'I his is to certify, that I
have been afflicted with the Chronic Rheumatism
for ten years past, and have used two bottles of
Dr. Shubael Hewes* Rheumatic Liniment, and it
effected a perfect cure. Russel Canfield.
Each bottle has stamped upon it the name of
the article, and each wrapper is signed by the
Proprietor. I. F. Thayer

COMPOUND CHLORINK
TOOTH WASH,
For Cleaning and Preserving the Teeth and
Cleansing the Mouth.
THE Compound Chlorine Tooth Wash
effectually cleanses the Teeth, and will an
swer the purposes of the best dentifrice. It con
tains no acid or any ingredient which can in any
case be injurious. It will also be found to keep the
brush itself free from all impurities. It has the
further advantage of cleansing ihe mouth also;
and of removing whatever is offensive in the
breath. Il hardens Ihe gums, and is a valuable
remedy for the canker or soreness of the mouth.
| In fine it preserves the teeth and mouth in all
| respects in a clean and healthy condition. It is
I agreeable to the taste. Gentlemen, who are in
the habit of using tobacco, will find t%at the tooth
wash will speedily remove all ihe effects of it from
the mouth.
That the public may rest assured of the very
salutary effects of this composition the following
I recommendations which have been received by
Lowe Sc Reed, Proprietors, are suLmitled.
From C. H. Stedman, M. 1) —U. S. Marine
Hospital, March 9, 1831. Having examined and
employed ihe Chlorine Tooth Powder, prepared
by you. I feel happy to say that I am fully con
vinced of ils utility in diseases of the teeth and
| gums and with this view I cheerfully recommend
it l« the attention of the public. C. H- Stedman.
I From S. A. Shurtleff, M. D. Boston. March
। 15, 1831. 1 have used your Compound Chlorine
I noth B ash and find it an excellent article for re
moving the Jedd breath from decayed teeth, and
also in restoring the gums when spongy, lo per
iect health. On using it in the evening, it will
preserve a sweet and pleasant taste in the mouth
। tiuring the whole night. 1 have prescribed it in
j diseases occasioned by mercurials, and find it ex
cels all other remedies in restoring the mnuth lo
a healthy state, in a shorttime. S. A. Shuhtleff.
1 From J, B. Flint, M. D. Boston, March 16,
*B3l- I have administered the Compound Chlo
rine Fcolli Wash you were good enough to put
• into my hands, and at your request am very will
( ing to say, that the result of my little experience
confirms ihe opinion I had formed of it from a
knowledge of its composition. I believe it to be
i an ingenious, agreeable, and efficacious prepara
| tion tor preventing the offensive effects efdeprav
ed secretions in the mouth, and for invigorating
and preserving the gums. Josh. B. Flint.
From J, IV. Webster, M. D.. Erving Profes
sor of Chemistry in Harvard University. Har

have examined the Compound Chlorine Tooth
i /sash, received from you, and have no hesitation
instating my belief that it will answer the pur
| pose for which you have compounded it- 1 have
discovered in it no ingredient which c:hi prove
'injurious to ihe teeth. J. W. IFebster.

FOR VICE PRESIDENT,

Free Soil State Nominations.
FOR GOVERNOR,

FREE SOIL LECTURERS.
Applications for Speakers, by our friends in the neigh
boring towns, should be made to Wm. A. Wallace,
Corresponding Secretary of ihe Worcester Freedom
Clnb, at this office, who will promptly attend to ail calls
of that character
MEETING IN HOLDEN.
Amasa Walker will address the Citizens of Holden
on Monday evening the 18lb inst. by request of the Free
Soil Association of that place.
an unknown,and therefore irresponsible clique of “rough
and ready” ratifiers, from behind their concealment,, and
with their characteristic bravery, been throwing
mud and missiles-at the Spy. The open and undisguis
ed advocacy of the humane and patriotic principles of
the great Free Soil party' of the nation, which distin
guishes our paper, could hardly be expected to escape
the malignant demonstrations of the secret and unscru
pulous agents of the new third parly organization. Hav
ing set about to defaet an election by the people, in ""the
desperate hope of success, by throwing ihe choice
Electors, Governor, &c., into the Legislature, it is not
strange, that for the accomplishment of so unjustifiable a
purpose, such agents should resort to discreditable
means.
* The Organ complains of our suggestion that Abra
ham Lincoln was a defeated candidate. We knew that
a Cass man had been elected in Ins district, and hence
inferred, erroneously,as appears, that Mr L. was the de
feated candidate. It turns out, however, that it was
another Taylor candidate who was defeated —M r Lincoln,
foreseeing the danger, having prudently withdrawn him
self. We are always happy to correct mistakes. We
can advocate no cause which needs any thing but truth
for its support.
Next, the aforesaid Organ, with all becoming civility,
accuses us of telling “ two lies,” in our account of the
Third Party Convention. The first, in reference to
Myron Lawrence’s motion to arrest the balloting for
Governor, and to nominate by acclamation. It quotes
us thus:
‘He gave as a reason, that “ last year, under the darks
ness of the ballot,” twenty or more members had dared
to vote against Messrs. Briggs and Reed !’
And the organ adds, —“This is literally a lie. He
Mo. euJ. and the wnto, of ihu abovo pnra-
graph probably knew it.” Now, with due deference to
this pupil of the “Old Zach” school of manners, we take
the liberty to say that the al>ove paragraph is true
literally true—Mr. Lawrence having used the very
words ascribed to him. This we can prove, if need be,
by judicial evidence.
The second “lie” is by the Organ of the
Taylor faction, —“a crowning one,” it says:
“The Convention agreed to adopt these gentlemen
(Messrs. Briggs and Reed) amidst the noisiest sort of
demonstrations, and prevented an exposure oj the dis.
sensions which, prevailed in relation to the nominations
and which had come nigh leakittg out.”
Now, we have good evidence, that there was a diver,
sity of ballots in circulation. It is also well understood,
that many of the Taylor faction had been for a long
time desirous of nominating a new candidate in prefer
ence to Gov. Briggs. Presuming, therefore, that Mr
Lawrence was apprehensive that the same feeling of diss
content which he described as having disturbed the des
sired harmony of the Whig Convention of last year,
would break out yet more formidably on this occasion,
unless promptly suppressed,—we thought, and still
think, that theobject of his movement was, to drown the
voices of the disaffected, by loud and boisterous huzzas
We challenge the Taylor Organ to deny, if it
that there were members of that Convention opposed to
the nomination of Gov. Briggs. Mr. Lawrence said
there were twenty-two last year. Will the Organ dare
say, that the number of malcontents were not this year
largely increased 1
The vaporing of tlie faction’s organ, about ' 65,000
whig voters,” is merely laughable. “Wait a little lon

Vermont. Wm. Henry, Whig, is elected to Con
gres from the Ist District, and probably Geo. P. Marsh-
W.,inthe3d. In the 2d and 4th there is no choice.
In the Legislature of this State, the Whigs have a ma
jority on joint ballot of 23, only 4 more than last year
out of 220 members, if here is any thing to boast of’
by the Taylorites, that even will be wrested from them
in November—the State is more likely for Van Buren
than for 1 aylor. The popular vote for Governor shows
the Whigs this year to be in a minority of over 5,000—
last year about half that number. By November the
free Soil candidates will lead, and be chosen, as a plu
rality chooses for Electors.
(Lz* I” the preparation of matter for a daily puper, it
is impossible that it should all pass under the revision of
the Editor, especially when he is necessarily fiom home,
a portion of the time ; and, sometimes, articles are pub
lished, which he would prefer should have been omitted.
Such is the case in relation to a paragraph in yesterday’s
Spy relating to cases of intoxication on Wednesday —
In relation to the facts, whether it was true, or not, he
had no opportunity of personal observation during the
afternoon, for he was out of the city. While at home he
saw nothing of the kind. If true, ho certainly would not
be disposed to speak of it, to the disparagement of the
Convention there assembled j for he has no hesitaiion in
expressing his high personal respect for the members of
it, so far as he knows any thing of them, in all respects
except the political scheme in which they are engaged.
It certainly embraced a great amount of talent and per
tonal worth. We wish we could speak as favorably of
its political character.
The New York Taylor Stale Convention has nomina

Patterson for Lieut. Governor,
I’he Magazine of Horticulture for Septem
ber is received, and would have been sooner noticed
but for our pressing engagements. It contains descrip
tions and drawings of the select varieties of Cheriies,
viz. the Florence, Black Eagle, and Downer or Down
er’s Late Red. We have these varieties, and agree en
tirely with the Editor as to their great excellence. There
is one drawback, however, to the Florence; in some
seasons it rots badly on the tree, before it is fully ripe.
It did so the past season. The Black Eagle is probably
the richest of all black cherries. The number also con
tains a drawing and description of a new seedling pear,
called “Pendleton’s Early York,” raisedin Connecticut,
which is said to ripen in July, and to be superior to the
Madeleine. Another article recommends the Bloodgood
as a first rate August pear, and condemns in toto the
Belle de Bruselles or Belle d’Aout, which has recently
been highly recommended in the Genesee Farmer.
Ashburnham, Sept. 13 1848,.
Editor of the Spy—Sir —The cause of “Free Soil”
having become a fixed fact, and as there has as yet been
no public demonstration to prove the existence of any’
of the old political parties in this place, 1 have thought
proper to state in a few words, th t a meeting was held
at the Town Hall Sept. 4th, of tlose opposed to Cass
and Taylor, and after choosing a Chairman, it was vot
ed to choose six Delegates and as many Substitutes to
attend the State Convention at Btston; also, voted to
organize by the choice of the usual board of Officers,
and chose C. Stearns, A. Whiling, Vice
President; Simeon Merritt, Secretary; J. A. Conn
Treasurer; J. D. Crbsley, Walter Whitney, Jos P.
Rice Gilman Jones and J. C. Glazier, Executive Com
mittee. A Committee of one or more for each School
District was then chosen to present the Constitution for
signatures.

with a fair prospect of a large increase when the time
for voting arrives.

ro’ Mass., tells a first rate story.
“In conclusion, I would say that the cause of Free
Soil in old Marlboro’ is onward. A Cass or I'aylor
mau is an article so rarely seen, as to have b ecome a
perfect curiosity. We number about 500 voters in town
and it is thought by those who have good opportunit es
for judging, that not more than 50 can be reckoned for
both Cass and Taylor together.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA QUES
TION IN 1840.
Looking over recently the debates in Congress
in 1840, on the resolutions of William Cost John
son, ot Maryland, against the reception ot Anti-
Slavery petitions, in which the subject-matter of
these petitions—the abolition ot slavery in the
District of Columbia—was discussed more or less
by most of the speakers, we have noted one or
two facts which illustrate the position and views
ot even Northern Whigs at that period.
With the exception of Ex-Governor Slade,
(now a Free Soil man,) we find none of the
speakers in favor ot granting the prayer ot these
petitions.
Biddle, of Pennsylvania, a leading and influ
ential Whig member, in the course of his speech
took occasion to remind the Democrats that their
candidate for re-election, President Van Buren,
had declared the right of Congress to abolish sla
very in the District.
Aanderpoel, ot New York, here rose and ask
ed him it Mr. Van Buren did not also state that
he considered the exercise of the right so danger
ous and inexpedient, that ha «hnuU. Mta a bill
for such a purpose.
“Yes,” returned Biddle, ‘""and does not every
gentleman on this floor say the same thing?''’
Judge Hunt, ot New York, another leading
Whig, made a labored and ingenious speech, dis
claiming, on the part of himself and his Whig
friends of the North, any sympathy with the Ab
olition petitioners. We give an extract:
“He (Mr. H.)did not believe the North had
any right to interfere with the question of do
mestic slavery; and he did not blame Maryland
and Virginia, the States that ceded this District,
because they told the North they had no right
to interfere. They had done as he would have
done.”
He concluded bis speech with the following
emphatic declaration :
“As a representative in part of the Empire
State and the North, he would never vote for the
abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,
without the consent of those States.”
We recall these declarations at this time, sim
ply to show that President Van Buren’s views
on the subject of slavery in 1837 were endorsed
by leading Whigs of the North in 1840. While
we design no excuse for the course of the form
er twelve years ago, we think.it those only who*
weie at that time without sin are to cast stones
at him, he will escape with few bruises.— Wash,

Board of Foreign Missions. The Amer
ican Board of Missions held the first of their
meetings at the Tremont Temple, Boston, Tues
day afternoon. The meeting was called to order
by the President, Hon. Theodore Frelinghusen,
and was opened by prayer by Rev. Dr Snell.
Some business arrangements relating to the So
ciety were then made and the annual reports
read, after which the Board adjourned to meet in
the same place at 7 1-2 o’clock in the evening
to listen to a sermon by the Rev. Dr. Ferris of
New York.
The annual report, (the thirty ninth) shows the
following to be the receipts and expenditures :
The whole amount received into the treasury
of the board, the last year, is $254,056 46, ex
ceeding that ot the year before by $42,653 70
being an advance of more than 20 per cent.—’
The expenditures tor all purposes, during the
same period, ambunted to $282,330 38, being
$17,546 55 more than those of the last year and
$28,273 92 more than was received into’ the
treasury ; and of course, increasing the indebted
ness of the Board by that amount. The excess
in the outlay was owing to some unexpected ex-
in distant missions. The debt, which
at the last annual meeting was $31,616 86 was
on the 31st of July last, $59,890 78.

in aleiter to me.dated the
10th of that month, he re
ports that conversation in

passed by Congress, ap
proved by Washington,
and upheld by the Judie
iary, the constitutionality
of the measures has been
settled by ail departments
of the Government, and

THE DEAD SEA.
According to an account of Lieut. Maury in
the Southern Literary Messenger, this expedi
tion was planned by Lieut. Lynch, and assented
to by the Secretary of the Navy in the Spring of
1847. The store ship “Supply” took out Lieut.
Lynch and two metalic boats as transports.-—
These boats were carried over mountain gores
and precipices by the party appointed for the ex
pedition, and on the Blb of April, 1848, they
were launched upon the Sea of Galilee. The
Richmond Republican has condensed the inter
esting article of Lieut. Maury as follows:
The navigation of the Jordon was found to be
most difficult and dangerous, from its frequent
and fearful rapids. Lieut. Lynch solves the se
cret ot depression between Lake Tiberias and
the Dead Sea by the tortuous course of the Jordan
which in a distance of sixty miles, winds through
a course of two hundred miles. Within this dis
tance Lieut. Lynch and his party plunged down
no less than twenty-seven threatening rapids;
besides many others of less descent. The differ,
ence of level between the two seas is over a
thousand feet.
The water of the Jordan was sweet to within
a few hundred yards of its mouth. The waters
of the sea were devoid of smell, but bitter, salt,
and nauseous. Upon enteTing it, the boats were
encountered by a gale, and “it seemed as if the
bows, so dense was the water,were encountering
the sledge hammers of the Titans instead of the
opposing waves of an angry sea.”
The party proceeded daily with their explora
tions,making topographical sketches as they went
until they reached the southern extremity ot the
sea, where the most wonderful sight that they
had yet seen awaited them.
“In passing the mountain of Uzdom (Sodom)
,we unexpectedly, and much to our own aston
ishment,” says Lieut. Lynch, “saw a large round
ed, turret-shaped column, facing south-east,
which proved to be ot solid rock salt, capped
with carbonate of lime, one mass of crystalliza
tion. Mr. Dale took a sketch of it, and Dr. An
derson and I landed with much difficulty,and pro
cured specimens of it.”
The party circumnavigated the lake, returned
to their place of departure, and brought back
their boats in as complete order as they received
them at New York. They were all in tine
health This is a specimen of the skill, system,
and discipline of the American navy. No na
tion in ihe world has such a service. The time
is coming when it will give proofs of that fact
palpable to the most dull understanding.
Thanks to the good management of Lieutenant
Lynch, the whole cost of this scientific explora
tion of the Dead Sea (except, of course, the cost
of equipage and maintenance of the crew ot the
ship) was but seven hundred dollars.
From ihe letters of Lieutenant Lynch, quoted
by Lieutenant Maury, we transcribe the follow
ing interesting facts elecited by the exploration :
“The bottom of the northern half of this sea is
almost an entire plain. Its meridional lines at a
short distance from the shore scarce vary in
depth. The deepest soundings thus tar 188 fath
oms, (1.128 feet.) Near the shore the bottom is
generally an Inci u»;atiuu ui salt, nut me inter
mediate one is soft mud with many rectangular
crystals—mostly cubes-of pure salt. At one
time Stellwager’s lead brought up nothing but
crystals. a
“The Southern half of the sea is as shallow as
the northern one is deep,and for about one-fourth
of its entire length the depth does not exceed
three fathoms, (18 feet) Its southern bed has
presented no crystals, but the shores are lined
with incrustations of salt, and when we landed at
Uzdom, in the course of an hour our foot-prints
were coated with crystallization.
“The opposite shores ot the peninsula and the
west coast present evident marks of disruption.
“There are unquestionably birds and insects
upon the shores, and ducks are sometimes upon
the sea, for we have seen them—but cannot de
tect any living thing within it; although the
salt streams flowing into it contain salt fish. I
feel sure that the results of this survey will full.v
sustain the scriptural account of the cities of the
plain.”
He thus speaks of Jordan: “The Jordan, al
though rapid and impetuous, is graceful in its
windings and fringed with luxuriance, while its
waters are sweet, clear, cool, and refreshing ”
After the survey ot the sea the party proceed
ed to determine the beighth of mountains on its
shores and to run a level thence via Jerusalem
to the Mediteranean. They found the summit of
the west bank ot the Dead Sea more than 1 000
abo ™ lta ,urfac ®» and ver y nesri y 0,1 a level
with the Mediterranean.
“’l?* ’ CUr \ ous ‘ a c‘.”says Lieut. Maury “that
the distance from the top to the bottom ol the
Dead Sea should measure the heights ot its banks
the elevation of the Mediterranean, and the dif
ference of level between the bottom of the two
seas and that the depth of the Dead Sea should
be also an exact multiple of the height of Jeru
salem above it.”
I i^ 0 T her n i?‘ • e ” 1 S J ngular sact > ln the ’’Pinion
Lieut. Lynch, is * that the bottom of the Dead
bea forms two submerged plains, an elevated
and a depressed one. The first, its southern part,
of slimy mud covered by a shallow bay; the last
its northern and largest portion, of mud and in
crustations and rectangular crystals of salt—at a
great depth, with a natrow ravine running
through it corresponding with the bed of the riv
er Jordan at one extremity, and the Waddy ’el
.< O Th Or r Bdy Wllhin a wady,’ at the other.”
The slimy ooze,” say. Lieut. Maury, “upon
that plun at ihe bottom of the Dead Sea, will not

PROGRESS OF THE CHOLERA.
At Treblzonde, Aug. Sth, although the great
er part of its inhabitants had fled to the surround
ing villages, the daily deaths numbered from
seventy to eighty. Among these is noticed the
wile of an American missionary. So great was
the panic, that e ven street-porters were not to
be found to transport merchandise to the Marina
for embarkation.
At Constantinople the disease had in some de
gree incressed, and the daily deaths are from
fifty to sixty, not merely confined to the lower
orders, for sevsral persons of distinction among
the Ottomans had fallen victims to it. At
na, for such ■ popMlMfon, the attacks (aboJt fifty
per diem) are very, few, but the mortality is 6f.
ty per cent, mi the attacks.
At Odessa it it on the decline; but some of the
neighboring village. h l yg suffered most awhillv

SELECTION OF FRUITS.
The season for setting trees being at hand, we copy
from tiie B< slon Journal, a report of Col. Wilder’s re
ma iss at the Agricultural Meeting i t the State ll<Mt»e
last week, with a select list of fruits, prepared by him,
as adapted to general cultivation. No higher authority,
probably, could be given for such a list. Yet we would
venture a few slight changes and additions givng our
reasons for the same, which if not satisfactory maybe
taken for what they ate worth.
In the first place, then, we should not place the M n
ister Apple in a select list of twelve. There are others
which combine higher qualities with superior general
productiveness. As a substitute.we should propose “Le
land’s Pippin”or the “Fameuse”—Leland’s Pippin has
been proved, in this vicinity, to be one of the very finest
and best, as it is one of the most beautiful apples in
cultivation : and the Fameuse ranks almost equally high.
To those who would enlarge the list, we can recom
mend the “Norther’’ as one of the finest late fall apples.
The Ladies’ Sweeting is the finest winter sweet apple
that we have seen, and is reputed to be a great bearer,
but it is a poor grower, and its adaptation to New Eng
land culture has not yet been fairly testeo. The North
ern Spy is a magnificent fruit, when grown in Western
New York, and sells now, in Boston market, at double
the price of common winter apples; but its adaptation
to our soil has not been proved. It requires high cub
ture, even m i s native region.
The greatest objection that we have to Col. Wilder’s
list of Pears, is, that it contains no very early variety.
We should add to it, the Citrou des Carmes, usually cal
led the Madeleine, which is an excellent and very pro*
ductive fruit, and ripens the last of July, nearly three
weeks earlier than any kind on the list, and at a time,
w hen such a fruit is most wanted. The reason of its
omission, we suppose to be, that it is said to be liable to
crack near the sea shore. It is quite common in this
vicinity and we never saw a cracked one. It is uniform
ly fair and handsome. If we could have but six kinds
we should take that for one of them.
The lleathcot, though sometimes of excellent quality, ;
as in 1847, is nevertheless very variable, and not to be
relied on. We should prefer to it, either the Rositier
the Dix, or the Lawrence. The Rositier is the test
summer pear we have eaten. It ripens the last of Aug.
ust, and is a great grow er and good bearer. The D.x
ripens in November and is first rate. The Lawrence is
a very valuable native fruit, ripening in November and
December. The tree is a good grower, hardy and pro
five, the fruit uniformly fair, of excellent quality, and
ripens well.
We should recommend, in addition to this list, if
grown on quince, the White Doyenne, or St Michael,and
the Gloui Morceau. They are both fruits of the highest
excellence, but are uncertain on the pear stock. We
believe they are uniformly good ou the quince. The St
Michael ripens in October—the Glout Morceau from
me last of November to February.
Fatal Disease. We learn that a dis ase of a most
malignant character prevails in Sutton and its vicinity,
to a considerable exten.*. Almost every case of attack,
thus far has proved mortal. The precise nature of the
disease seems not to be understood. Some have called
it spotted fever, others the cholera. We understand that
a post mortem examination of one of the cases was to be
made on Saturday, by a council of physicians.
The Scalpel. A Journal of Health, adapted to
popular and professional reading, and the exposure of
quackerv. Edited by Edwatd H. Dixon M. D. New
Yoik, 1819.
Dr D.xon is already well known by previ-. us publi
cations, intended to give important medical knowledge
to the public, and to strip away the mystery with which
it has too long been attempted to shroud the medical
profession. He is a pupil ot the celebrated Dr V. Mott
mid a physician of 18 years successful praciice in New
York city. The present work is to tie issued quarterly
at SI per year, to be remitted, post paid, directly to the
Editor, Box 3121, New York Bost Office. The next
number will be issued in May. If the Editor is suc
cessful in his attempt to expose quackeiy, especially in
the profession, he will do his country good service, for
verily it is, in the healing art, that humbug sits enthron
el, and exercises his w idest dominion. We ate much
pleased with the number before us, and believe the work
will do good.
Connecticut. A Free Soil Convention for the
3d Congressional District held at Norwich on 'Tuesday
the 13th iust. nominated Chauncey F Cleveland, late
governor of die state, as candidate for member of Con.
gress. A letter from the nominee was read, and has
Been published in v hich he avows himself strongly in
Rvor of the exclusion of slavery, from all the territories,
and its abolition in the District of Columbia. He de
clares that lie could never consent to the admission of
any more stave states in the Union, and subscribes to
the doctriues ol the Bufia'o platform. He has also been
nominated by the Democratic Convention, and will
doubtless be dieted over Judge Rockwell, the late
member who, it will be remembered, voted against
Gott’s resolution.
From Washington. In the Senate, on Friday,
Mi. Atchison was unanimously appointed President pro
tern.
Charles W. Rockwe'l of Conn., was confirmed as
Commissioner of Customs; Alien A Hall of Tennessee,
Register of the Treasury; James E. Norflier, Collector
of Edenton, North Carolina; Zebedee Ring, Survey or
at New York.
Seaton Gales has been nominated Secretary of Lega,
lion at Berlin; Fletcher Webster, U. S. District Aitor
ney for Boston; Leßoy, Navy Agent for New York.
Qj* The Senate is expected to adjourn on Tuesday
next. Col. Webb has “gone home,"" with no other ap.
pomtment, or offer of a place, than that of a clerkship
in the Treasury Department.
The office-seekers are beginning to despair, and many
are turmiig their faces homeward, dis-appointed.
Mr. Hughes, of Ohio, is appointed Commissioner ot
Pensions, in place ot James L. Edwards.
Mr. William Medill, Commissioner of the Indian De
p?rtmeut, it is said will be retained in office.
REV. DR. BAIRD.
Perhaps it may not be amiss to say a lew words to
die numerous readers of your paper, regarding this gen
tleman and the object of his visit here. It is wellkuown
that three y ears ago he lectured in Worcester, on some
of the countries of Europe, 'loose who attended this
course, need not now to be reminded of the interesting
manner in which Dr B. communicates his varied and
extensive fund of information. Since that time, he has
made the entire tour of Europe, and has of course, ad
ded largely to his original stock of knowledge I. will
conduce to the interest of these lectures, that he has had
prepared a seiics of maps, and a large number of paint
mgs illustrative of the costumes and customs of the va
rious countries.
Perhaps, none of the many lecturers who visit us,
hate done, or possess the faculty ol doing, m< re to in
terest and instruct their audience, than Dr B Highly
gifted by nature, and favored by Providence, withmoie
opportunities for acquiring informa ion than has been
possessed by almost any other man, there is in bis mode
of speaking, none of that egotism which might here, i
ever, be excusable. Kind and familiar in bis manner,
he possesses in a high degree, the happy faculty of ro
blending the instructive and entertaining, as never to
weary Hie listener. His fund oi statistical information
is indeed valuable. It has not been acquired from hear
say or from books, but by his own personal observation,
and from the public documents of ihc various kingdoms
which be has visited. There never was a time when
such information was more needed than the present.—
Europe is convulsed to its centre, and revolution follows
revolut.on, in such rapid succession, that books are far
behind the age. His recent visit, and bis extensive cor
respondence, enables him to place before his hearers, as
no one else can, the present condition of those coun
tries,
ToThe young, and especially to those whose means
are limited, permit me lo say, that it is very seldom that
an opportuni y occurs of acquiring so much valuable in
formation, with so little expenditure of lime and monev.
The low price of the lectures places them within the
reach of all, while the object to >■ Inch the funds are de
voted, presents an additional motive to attend them —
All Ilie avails, beyond the simple expenses, aie plidged
to the Foreign Evangelical Society. Three lectures of
the course have already been delivered—the six which
remain, on the principal divisions of Europe, will be, if
possible, more replete witli interest, than those that have
preceded. Ihe subjects of the lectures on Tuesday and
1 hursday of this week, are Germany France and Swit
zerland.
We hope that all your readers will avail themselves
of this double opportunity of getting and doing good,
and cheer the heart of this gentleman and philanthropist

Fire. The woodbouse at the Clintonville station of
the Worcester and Nashua Rail Road, was set fire to
on Friday night between II and 12 o’clock and burnt
down with a considerable quantity of wood. Two
fieight cars standing on the track were also burnt. An
attempt was made to break into the passenger station,
but without success.
We would call the attention off such of our readers
as have occasion for any kind of hair work, either fancy
or plain to the advertisement of J. W. Collier. By vis
iting his room they will see a great variety of specimens
of exquisite woikmanship and taste.
A Slave’s Revenge. We learn from the
Danville (Va ) Register, that on Saturday week,
a negro woman, belonging to Dr. John James, of'
Wentworth, N. C., brutally murdered his only
child, an interesting little daughter, about three
years old, and also a negro boy belonging to the
same gentleman, and a tew years older than the
little girl, by cutting their throats with a caso
knife. She enticed the children into the woods,
and whilst sawing upon the boy’s throat, who
she afterwards had the coolness to declare “kick
ed mightily,” the simple but touching appeals of
the innocent little girl were pleading lot his re
lease. The little girl was staggering about with
the blood streaming from her mangled throat,
when the inhuman wretch left the bloody scene.
The citizens turned out en masse and arrested
her. and it was feared lor a while they would
lynch her, Her excuse is that her master had
threatened to sell her, tor a misdemeanor.
A New Version of ""Pistols and Coffee."" A
man in New O. leans, who had offended another,
next day received the following missive : “On
the Ist ot March, at 8 o’clock in the morning, in
the Cotton press yard, with a pair of pistols and a
Coffin. ”
Wine for Communion Service. Frederick A.
Paige, ot Providence, was convicted last week
for a violation of the license law. The Day Star
says it was proved that the defendant had sold a
small quantity ot wine for communion service,
and as the object could not be deemed one for
medicinal or artistical purposes, he was mulcted
in the usual fine, twenty dollars, which he de
clined to pay, and appealed to a higher court.
IT A mother admonishing her son, a lad
about 7 years of age, told him he should never
defer till tomorrow what he could do today. The
little urchin replied, “Then, mother, let’s eat the
remainder of the plum pudding 'o night.
Science in the Kitchen. Professor Liebig in
a letter to Prot. Silliman, says : The method of
roasting is obviously the best to make flesh the
most nutiitious. But it does not follow that boil
ing is to be interdicted. 11 a piece of meat be
put into cold water, and this heated to boiling
and boilded until it is “done,” it will become
harder and have less taste, than if the same
piece had been thrown into water already boiling
In the first case the matters giatetul to the
smell and taste, go into the extract—the soup; in
the second, the albumen of the meat coagulates
from the surface inward, and envelopes the in
terior with a layer which is impregnable to wa
ter.
, T . HE A .y ° F Walking is the
best possible exercise. Habituate yourself to
wa k very far The Europeans valve themselves
on having subdued the horse to the use of man,
but I doubt whether we have not lost more than
we have gained by this animal. For no one
thing has occasioned so much degeneracy ot the
human body. An Indian goes on foot nearly as
far in a day, as an enfeebled white does on his
horse.and will lire the best horses. A little
walk of half an hour in the morning, when you
first use, is advisable. It shakes off sleep and
produces other good effects in the animal econo

The Canal Bank, Albany. There has
been a fresh development of iniquity concerning
this exploded institution in a report to the Legis
lature. It develops astounding corruption for
years on the part ot its cashier, and some ot its
directors. Theodore Olcott, the Cashier,owes the
bank $300,000, —more than the amount of it capi
tal, and Editor Croswell’s indebtedness is increas
ed to $200,000. Four days belore the failure,
the name of Thomas W. Olcott was changed on
the bond of the Cashier, to those of Thaddeus
Joy and Edward Artcher. There is evidence
also of collusion betwen the Canal Bank and the
Farmers & Mechanics Bank. To show the feel
ing which prevades the Albany public concern
ing these iniquitous developments, we quote the
tollowing from the Express of that city :
The evidence is especially startling and sick
ening horn the corruption it indicates. Thomas
W. Olcott was on the stand eight hours in suc
cession. His statement is sufficient to damn
every one ol that name for the next century.
Public indignation will imperiously demand their
removal from the city. Albany must no longer
be contaminated by the pesence of such a man.
This robber ol the widow and orphan ot his bene
factor and earliest friend, has been tolerated long
enough by this community. No matter how ex
alted his financial position may have heretofore
been—no matter how spledid the palace he may
have erected lor his residence—he mu-t go!
There is a point, beyond which forbearance
ceased to bs a virtue. That point he has reach

The President and the Brewer. A
French paper published in Montpelier, relates
the following anecdote : “Mr. E S ,
a young man of our city, was educated in Swit
zerland, where his family formerly resided. One
day, while taking a walk along the shores of the
river, a shriek of alarm and despair suddenly
strikes his ear. He hastens to the spot, and per
ceives a young man, who having become entan
gled amidst the weeds, struggled in vain, against
a horrid death. -To throw oil his clothes, and fly
to the rescue of the unfortunate man, was, tor
the courageous youth, an affair of a moment, and
he was fortunate enough to bring the drowning
man safely to the shore. The gratitude of the
rescued youth may easily be imagined. ‘Had
you been in my place, and I in yours, what would
you have done.” asked Mr. S. ‘Upon my word,
I would not have hesitated an instant to do the
same!’ ‘Well, then, you see that 1 do not de
serve so many thanks.’
However, by dint of entreaties, Mr. E. S. con
sented to give his card and address to him whose
life he has just saved. The next day the young
man called upon him, and after having renewed
his protestations ot gratitude, begged ot him to
accept two souvenirs. The first was a magnifi
cent pipe in ecume de mer; the second a medal
lion, richly framed enclosing a portrait ot Louis
Bonaparte, ex King of Holland, on the edge of
the frame the following inscription was written :
‘Souvenir d’ amitie et reconnaissance,oflert aM.
E S par son tout devoue serviteur,
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.’ Many yearshave
gone by since the above incident occurred. To
day the rescued youth is President of the French
Republic, and his preserver is a brewer at Mont
pelier.”
Terrible Crevasse at Iberville. A
despatch from Baton Rouge, to the editors ot the
Cresent, communicates the following alarming
information :—
Baton Rouge, March 4. The river has brok
en through the levee in two different places,each
forty yards wide and about one hundred and fifty
yards apart. The upper one is at Bavet’s Ball
room —The Church, Kirklands, Molaison’s, Col.
Stewart’s,Soniat’s Patrick’s plantations and others
under water. There is at least eight feet fall
from (he river, and the greatest danger is ap
preliended. The Mayor of Baton Rouge has
just returned faom the scene, and says it is an
awful sight. [The crevasses must be in the parish
of Iberville, below Baton Rouge and on the op
posite side ot the river.]
A Lesson for Scolding Wives. “Andi
dare say you have scolded you wile very often,
Newman,” said I once.
Old Newman looked down, and his wife took
up the reply—
“ Never to signify—and if he has, I deserved
it!”
“And I dare say, if the truth were told, you
have scolded him quite as often.”
“Nay,” said the old woman with a beauty of
kindness, which all the poetry in the world can
not excel, “Hoiv can a wife scold her good man
who has been working lor her and her little ones
all the day? It may do lor a man to be peevish,
for it is he who bears the crosses of the world;but
who should make him forget them but his own
wile? And she had best lor her own sake—for
nobody can scold much when the scolding is all
on one side.”
Washington correspondent of the New
York Commercial states that Mr Hannegau has

AGRICULTURAL MEETING.
The ninth Legislative Agricultural meeting
was held at the State House on Tuesday evening,
the Hon. Marshall P. Wilder, President of the
Society, in the Chair. Subject for discussion
Fruit and Fruit Trees.
The discussion was commenced by Col. Wilder
who spoke as follows ; •
The Culture of Fruit Trees, or in mod.
ern language the science of Pomology, occupies
a field ol research so wide, that a thorough dis
cussion of the subject would engross more time
than is allotted to our meetings during any one
session ot the Legislature. The grain and veg
etables of the earth may be considered as the
necessary and more substantial blessings of Prov
idence, but I have ever viewed the delicious
fruits of the orchard and garden as ihe overflow
ings of his bounty, and whether as a luxury,
contributing to health, and the gratification of the
appetite, or as a profitable crop lor the larmer,the
subject has quite too often been esteemed only as
of secondary importance.
Formerly the cultivation of the finer fruits was
limited to the gardens of the opulent, or to the
immediate proximity of a market, but the multi
plied facilities ot intercourse and transportation,
the emulation excited by Horticultural exhibi ’
tions and conventions, ano the increasing impor
tance ot this product irr a commercial po ntj of
view, has awakened an interest which has spread
as with magnetic speed, throughout our land.—
Thousands of trees are planted instead of dozens;
orchards and gardens on the most extensive scale
have been commenced,and so generally has this
taste been diffused in our vicinty, that (fie cot
tage even of the most humble laborer, without
its fruit tree or grape vine, would almost be con
sidered an anomaly. Amateurs and nurserymen
have congregated into their coUections hundreds
of varieties for trial; and so g?eat is this enthu
siasm or mania, that the cry is not simply “who
will show us any good,” but who will show us
anything new. Fears have been expressed that
this fruit growing mania.would overstock the
market, but thus far it has tended to foster a
taste for better quality, better specimens, and to
augment rather than to diminish the piice.
In no part of the world is this enterprise
crowned with better success than in our own.—
The fame of American fruit is already proverbial
in foreign markets, and the day is not distant,
when, in addition to the enormous consumption
at home, we shall supply England with the finest
pears, as we now do the finest apples that appear
in her ii arkets.
A gentleman, (P. Barry, Esq, of Rochester,N.
Y.) who has just returned from Europe, remarks
that in the English market there will be an “un
failing demand lor the products of our orchards,”
that apples such as would scarcely sell at home,
were there cried up as “nice American apples,”
“beautiful American apples,” and brought from
three to six cents each. Mr. B. says he exam
ined in the fruit rooms of the London Horticul
tural Society “200 to 300 varieties ol fruit, and
that there was not a single large, clear, wellcol
lored specimen among them.” The same gen
tleman took out with him specimens of the North
ern Spy apple, (which we now have before us)
and some other varieties; they elicited the admira -
tion of all, and indeed, says he “there are no such
apples in England.”
With the zeal so generally manifested on this
subject, it becomes a matter of importance to as
certain the best mode of culiivation ; but so
much has already been published on the soil,
management and selection of fruit trees, that I
can hardly expect to add anything new. There
are, however, some considerations “that lie at
the root of the matter,” and which it is believed
must be adopted as a sine qua non, to ensure
success, viz;
1. The selection of such sorts, and only such,
as by uniformity of character, in various locali
ties, particularly our own, have, alter a trial of
years, been proved to be hardy, productive, and
of excellent quality.
2. The right soil, and the proper preparation
of it.
3. The appropriate manure.
Much disappointment has been experienced by
selecting varieties from their high sounding
names and novelty, rather than from any known
superiority ol character. To avoid this prevalent
error, and in compliance with frequent requests,
I submit a list in the various classes of fruits,
which from the united experience of cultivators
seem well adapted to our region, and to possess
generally the characteristics alluded to ; and to
make this as useful as possible 1 have graduated
it to limited selections for small gardens.

Hon. John C. Gray, made some remarks in re
lation to the importance of sub soiling or trench
ing the soil thoroughly before planting trees.
He thought we were not careful enough in tak
ing up trees from the nursery,—that they should
be approached with care at the extremities of the
root, instead of cutting in upon them at ran
dom.
Our climate is better for fruit trees than that
of England. Air. Gray said he preferred stand
ard to dwarf trees, and thought the quality ot the
fruit better. Trees do not need much pruning if
properly commenced with when young. He
approved oi shortening in the young wood of
peach trees.
Mr. Rice of Newton, thought there had not
been attention enough paid to the destruction of
insects, that although the farmer would take
great pains to re plant a few hills of corn which
had been pulled up by the birds, lie would al
low a caterpillar’s nest to destoy the whole crop
of a fruit tree which was worth more than a
whole field ot corn. The eggs ot the caterpil

appearance among us, with his petitions to Congress,
praying for the abolition of corporal punishment and
the extinguishing of the spirit ration in our navy. Mr.
Haynes and his mission have lectured on those subjects
with good effect in different cities of the Union, and
come xycll recommended. They are obtaining signa
tures for the above named objects. They will likely
remain a few days with us, and we sincerely hope all
our citizens who have a spark of sympathy for the poor
toiling seamen of our navy, will manifest it by signing
those petitions, and aiding him as much as possible to
promote that object. Comment on it is useless. Pub

; TRIAL OF PROF. J. W. WEBSTER
FOR THE MURDER OF DR. PARKMAN.
DERASTUS CLAPP’S TESTIMONY CONCLUDED.
I then told hint it was necessary for me to take
from Inin such things as it would’not be ptoper to
j take into jail. He handed me his gold watch, a
I wallet, five keys, $2,40 in- money, and an omnibus
ticket case. Among the keys was this one [shows
key marked “privy.”] These articles were all put
into a bundle, carried to the marshal’s office, and
there locked.
I A mittimus was then made out by myself, and
. while I was doing it, he was in charge of officers
, Spurr and Starkweather. Then Spurr and I went
to the marshal's office. Didn’t find the marshal,
and then proceeded to the college, where we found
Dr W ebster in custody of two jail officers. There
was a call for the key of the privy. Littlefield
brought something like sixteen keys, but neither
would fit the lock, and the door had to be forced.
At tnat time 1 did not know that I had the key mark
ed “privy”—did n’t notice it when I took it. Nei
ther of the keys I took from the doctor or from his
house at Cambridge, fitted the frontdoors of the Col
lege The keys only fit his own doors, and one lead
ing into Mr Littlefield’s cellar. One key fitted his
doors.
boon after I went in, I found the doctor in great
tremor, as if he were in a fit. Water was procured,
lie trembled so that his teeth struck the tumbler as it
was presented to him. He did not appear to know
what was going on. He was agitated. Disappear
ance was like that of a person whom 1 have seen
with the delirium tremem—more like trembling
madness than anything else.
Ihe first time I searched his house was the next
morning, Saturday, Dec. Ist. 'L ite search did not
amount to much. We did not find what I went for.
The papers in .the trunk were all done up neatly.
They were mostly old papers. We certainly did not
see the package the first day.
Cross-examined—lt was before we left Cambridge
that I told him there was to be another search at the
college, and it was desired that he should be pres
ent. He said he should not lose anything whether
the doctor was found or not. He thought not, for he
believed the doctor was an honest man, and if Tie
was he should not.
Chailes W. Little—l reside in Cambridge. I
knew Dr Parkman. Between one and two on
Thursday, Nov. 22, I met him very near Mr. Wil
liam Saunders’s, on the street leading to the observ
atory, on the side nearest the Appian way He was
riding in a chase. He asked me where Dr Webster
lived. I recollect the day, because I went to New
V ork the next day, and got back on Sunday morn
ing. Dr Parkman was alone.
Seth Pettee—l reside in Dorchester. On the 7th
Nov. last I commenced collecting the funds of the
Medical College faculty. There are seven profes
sors connected with that faculty, and my duty is to
dispose of the tickets, and receive the fees therefor.
My acquaintance with Dr. Webster commenced
then.
Hie first time I saw Dr Parkman, to know him,
was on the 12th of Nov. lie came to the bunk to
inquire if 1 collected the funds of the Medical Col
lege. I had no funds of Dr Webster in my hands al
that time, and 1 so stated to Dr Parkman. He made
some few remarks and immediately left the bank.—
In some 15 minutes after he returned, and took a
dividend which belonged to his wife. 1 then inquir
ed of him it Dr Webster owed him. He answered,
I should think you might judge from my manner. A
few days after he called on me again. It was the
day I paid Prof. Webster the $195. He asked me
if 1 had any funds of Dr Webster in my hands. I
told him 1 had just paid over to Prof. Webster all 1
had. He said he thought he had given me a hint to
retain the funds, or something to that effect. 1 told
him that I had no control over the funds. My dutv
was to pay them over to the different professors. lle
said, 1 should have been doing justice to Dr. Web
ster, to myseli, and to all concerned, if I had retain
ed the funds for him; for now he should be obliged
to distress Dr Webster and his family. I supposed
he meant by that, he would have to commence a
suit. He seemed to blame me for not retaining the
funds. I cannot state his precise language. The
purport and meaning of it was, that Dr Webster
was a dishonest man; that he was not an honorable
man; not an honest man. And he said, vou tell Dr.
Webster so from me. I never saw Dr Parkman af
ter that.
On the morning of the 23d of Nov., I went to the
college to see Dr Webster, to pay him over the S9O,
und found him in his upper room. 1 excused myself
to him for coming so early in the morning, by some
remarks of apology. 1 told him Dr Parkman had
called on me several times to know if I had any
funds of his, Dr Webster's, in my hands, and as 1
did not wish to have any trouble with Dr Parkman
by having any of his, Dr Webster’s funds, 1 had
come to pay him what I then Ind on hand. Dr.
Webster then said, Dr Parkman is a peculiar sort of
man nervous; and he has at times been subject to
fits of aberration of mind; so much so, that, he be
lieved, he did put his business out of his hands, and
that a Mr. Blake, a relative of his, attended to it.
After making these remarks he said—“ You will
have no furthei trouble with Dr Parkman, for 1 have
i settled with him.”
Between 4 and 5 o’clock that afternoon I wont
there again, having been sent for by Mr. Littlefield.
, A woman came out of the library, 1 thought, to op
en the door. But she only looked through the side
light and asked if I wanted to see Mr Littlefield.—
She told me I should find him by going round to the
east end. He met me at the door, dressed as usual
i but without shoes. I asked him if he had sent for
me. He said lie had. He wanted me to fill up a
set of tickets for P. R. Ridgway, who was to leave
the city in the morning.
I did not hear Dr Parkman use any profane words
at either interview, but he spoke harshly. 1 think 1
did not communicate Dr Parkman’s messa""e to Dr
Webster. 3
Cross-examined—l have no means of knowing
how many tickets Dr Webster may have sold. 1
keep only a record of the students who buy tickets
of me, which was 107.
Jno. B. Dana—l am the Cashier of the Charles
River Bank, ut Cambridge. Dr Webster in Nov.
last had an account with the Bank. [The Bink
book, found at Dr Webster's house, wus put in by
the the government.] J
During the month of Nov. Dr Webster deposited
at the bank, 10th, $275 90, in a check on
man’s Bank, Nov. 15th, $150; Nov. 24th, $l9O, n
chock on the Freeman’s Bank. On the 23d of Nov
the Bunk owed Dr Webster $139 16,before the $9()
was depositi-d. On the Ist Dec. Dr Webster drew
a check of $93 27, which paid rent. On Monday
he drew 5, 10, and sl9 in checks. At that tirin’
S6B 78, was trusteed, which was the balance du
Dr Webster by the Bank.
Dr Daniel Henchman—J am a druggist in Cu n
bridge street. I know Dr Webster. On the 2Jd
Nov. Dr Webster asked me if I could give him bills
for a check of $lO on the Charles River Bank. I
did eo, but have not teceived payment fur the same.
1 his was about 10 o’clock on !riday morning.
James 11. Blake, I am a nephew of the late Dr
Parkman. The Sunday after Dr Parkman’s disap
pearance, I went up North Grove street, towards the
College, about three o’clock. 1 was standing near
the east end of the building, talking with the Police
officers, when I saw Dr Webster come from the Col
lege. He took me by the hand,and said that on Sat
urday evening he saw in the Tarnscript, that Dr
Parkman was missing: that he came in on purpose
to notify the family ttiat be was the gentleman who 1
went to Dr Parkman’s house on Friday morning, and
। agreed to meet him at the College at half past one.
I T hat was the first 1 knew that Dr Parkman had gone
| to the College at that time. [Dr Webster gave to
the witness the same account of the payment ofmon- I
ey in the lecture room, as has been stated by other I
witnesses.] He then said he should go up and see
Rev. Dr Parkman about it. That he had gone to
church in the morning, and bethought he would wait
until after dinner before he came in. He then went
into the College. I approached the College from
North Grove street. 1 did not see Dr Webster on
that day. During the whole of our interview, he
held me by the hand, but 1 noticed nothing peculiar
in his manner.
Cross-examined. J was searching for Dr Park
man at the time; but 1 don't think 1 told Dr Web
ster of that fact.
Dr Francis Parkman, 43d Witness. lam a broth
er of the late Dr Parkman. 1 have known Dr Web
ster for many years. He once attended my church.
1 baptised bis family. After he removed to Cam
bridge, I still maintained an intimacy with him.—
Within two months of the disappearance of Dr.
Parkman, I was called upon to baptise the grand
child of Dr. Webster.
On Sunday, after the disappearance of Dr. Park
man, we were in great distress. None of us were at
church that day, but at my brother’s house. About
four o’clock, as people were passing from church,
Dr Webster came to my house. Immediately upon
entering the room, he said, “I came to tell you that
I saw your brother at half-past one, on Friday, and
paid him some money.” Some one of us then said,
“then you were the gentleman, who called at
George’s house, at half-past nine, Friday morning,
and made the appointment ?” He said he was, but
had not seen the notice until Saturday evening, and
had waited until then, thinking the family might
have been at church. 1 then said, “Dr Webster we
are glad to see you, because we had some fears that
one who meant him ill, hud made an appointment
with him at East Cambridge.”
Dr Webster then said, “I was the person. Y our
brother came, and I paid him $483 and some cents.”
I askiAl him if he was certain as to the hour, lie
replied that he was; that it was half-past one. I
then asked if he had papers in his had. Dr Webster
said yes; and that Dr Parkman took one of these
papers and dashed his pen through the paper. Dr
Webster represented the motion as one of suddei
ness and violence. That Dr Parkman said he would
see the mortgage discharged, and then went out very
rapidly from the lecture room.
I think I have a correct recollection of what Dr
Webster said and did—especially, as to the paper,
and dashing a pen through it.
1 could not but observe that his manner was very
earnest. He commenced by speaking in a business
tone the moment he entered. He expressed no sur
prise at the mysterious disappearance; and no sym
pathy in our grief. It seemed like a business visit.
1 have observed similar quickness of manner b fore.
It is characteristic. But [there was a certain flurry
which I had not observed before; but I was not so
much struck with that as the absence of any expres
sion of sympathy.
Dr Parkman’s habits were remarkable as to punc
tuality. He was almost invariably at his regular
meals, and seldom out of the city, though much
about in it. His daughter had been a great invalid,
and for her, he was perpetually anxious. At the
time, his son was in Europe.
1 have never heard Dr Parkman use language
properly called profane. When he was moved, lie
would express himself strongly, but not with profane
words.
Cross-examined. Fessenden and Oliver were the
names of the persons who said they hud seen my
brother. Dr Webster did not say what the paper
was which he had dashed bis pen through.
SEVENTH DAY.
Tuesday, March 26.
The Court was opened this morning at the usual
hour, the prisoner making his appearance a few min-,
utes before 9 o’clock. We observed nothing in his
air or maimer that differed in any particular from
that which has characterized him since his trial com
menced.
Ralph Smith, called and sworn. I reside in Bos
ton. lam a liquor dealer. He was owing me some
money. I wrote to him, and that [the letter identi
fied] was the reply. [The junior counsel for the
government read the letter, dated Cambridge, Oct.
15th, 1849, and it was then put into the case.
Samuel B. Fuller, called and sworn, lam oneof
the Police. 1 went to East Cambridge to see if the
mortgage was cancelled, and I was told I could as
certain better by going to the house of Dr. Webster.
I took a Mr. Thompson, I believe, in a chaise and
went to Dr. Webster’s house where we arrived about
dark. Mr. Thompson informed the Dr. what was
the object of our visit. Dr. Webster went to an ac
count book and appeared to tremble badly. He then
left the room. He sat down in a chair, and said,
“ it is strange that I can’t find those papers.”
He then had some conversation with the clerk,
Mr. Thompson, but what it was Ido not know. He
then sat down in a chair, and said, “My ticket man
told me that Dr. Parkman came to him anddemand
ed what money ho had in his possession for tickets
sold. My ticket man refused to let him have t4ie
money ; thereupon Dr. Parkman told my ticket man
that I was a d d rascal and a scoundrel.” Says
Dr. Webster, “ I thought hard of it at the time, but
I don’t care about it now, as I have settled with Dr.
Parkman, and it is all over.” He had some con
versation with the clerk, who went with me, and told
him that the mortgage wat on on personal properly
and not real estate.
[The witness then detailed the search in the col
lege on Tuesday, already described by Littlefield,
>ut which we will not repeat.]
I found one of the kidneys in the ash hole. There
were some bedclothes found. In the lower labora
tory, mi the table, were found a comforter and two
woollen blankets, done up in a newspaper. There
were some experiments made in regard to hearing
noises in Dr Holmes’s room, and in the laboratory”
I was below mid another person was up stairs; then
I went up and ho went below. 1 could hear nothing
and he raid that he could not.
Cross-examined—Tho knife was shut when I took
it from the tea chest. 1 told Mr. Thompson, the
clerk wh > went with me to Dr Webster's house,that
I thought he appeared very singular. I had no sus
pi •inn of him nt that time. His manner was rather
Singular, quick und nervous. Dr. Webster’s words
were that Dr Pnrkmen was at the college between
1 1-2 and 2 P. M.
Parkman Bl ike called and sworn. Am n r ilalive
of the lute Dr Parknitin. J had occasion to cill on
Dr Webster, o.i Monday morning, nt the College, be
tw ■( n the hours of 10 and 11 o’clock. Mr Littlefield
MkoJ my nini', ai l said that he would go round
the back way and give my name to Dr Webster.
1 waited what I thought was an unreasonable time
and 1 went in, when 1 saw Dr. Webster coming out
of his back private. He had on a smoking ca
' working dress, apparently. I took particular notice
। of Dr Webster’s appearance as 1 descended the steps
of the lecture room. He stood still until I approach
ed him. 1 told him that I had learned he had an in
‘ terview with Dr Parkman, and that I had come to
learn all the particulars of the interview. Dr Web
ster then went on to state that on Tuesday preceding
Dr Parkman’s disappearance, Dr Parkman had call
ed there before his lecture was finished.
After the lecture was finished Dr Parkman came
up to the table and said, “Doctor, I want some mon
ey”—he was very much excited and angry—“you J
have SSOO in your pocket, and I wart some of it.”
Dr Webster was lighted up and expressed great an
ger when he was relating the interview. Dr Web
ster told Dr Parkman that he would pay him on
Friday.-'
[We have already detailed the interview in the
lecture room between Dr Webster and Dr Parkman,
it does not differ materially from the statement of i
this witness.]
The witness continues. I asked him to recollect I
what money he paid him, as it was very important, !
and might lead to a discovery. He said that he
could recollect but one bill—a SIOO bill on the New
England Bank. 1 pressed Dr Webster to this close.
1 asked him if he had the notes of Dr Parkman.—
He answered in the affirmative, but in a way to make
a strong impression on my mind. He appeared con
fused. I asked him if anyone was present at the in
terview, when he said very emphatically—“ No.”
Then 1 left him. I noticed that his manner was sin
gular on my first entering his room. He seemed to
want that cordiality and politeness that is usual to
him. As I came down the lecture room, he looked
pale. His manner when speaking of Dr Parkman
being angry, was, I thought, singular. He made no
expression of sympathy; this I thought strange when
every person you met in the streets expressed so
much sympathy with the family of Dr Parkman.
He made no inquiries at all about the family of Dr
Parkman.
Cross Examined.—l heard of the disappearance of
Dr Parkman about 5 o’clock on Saturday afternoon.
I felt very great apprehension myself at that time.
Charles B. Starkweather sworn. Have been con
nected with the Police four years.
I made one of the party that went out to arrest Prof.
Webster. When we arrived at the jail we got out
and went into the back office. Mr Clapp and Mr Spurr
then left, to go and see if they could find the city mar
shal. Mr C. had searched him before he left. Imme
diately after they went out, Dr W. asked for some wa
ter, and drank several times. He asked me if they
had f. und Dr Parkman. 1 told him I wished he
would not ask me any questions, as it was not proper
for me to answer them. He said, “you might tell me
something about it. Where did they find him’ Did
they find the whole of the body! How' came they to sus
pect me l - Omy children! What will they dol’O what
will they think of me! Where did you get the infor
mationl”
I asked the Dr if any body had access to his priv
ate apartments but himself? “Nobody has access
to my private apartments but the porter that makes
the fire.” There was a pause of some minutes,and
he said, “That villain! I am a ruined man!” He
walked the floor, and wrung his hands, and then he
sat down. S.mn after he had a spasm, and was
stretched out like a man in a fit. Said I, “Doctor
have you been taking any tiling?” and he said, ‘No.’
I thought he appeared as if he had been taking some
thing. &
I lock hold of him and took him up, and he walk
ed the floor. 1 was with him about an hour. Mr.
Clapp came back and told me to commit the Doctor.
We conveyed him to the lock-up. We got him into
the berth, and laid him upon his side, and he turned
over on his face. He appeared like a man in a fit.
I left the jail about a quarter of a hour after, and
went to the Medical College. Dr Webster and sev
eral others were in the upper laboratory. 1 was
there at the breaking open of the privy door, and the
door of the little room. Dr Webster was very much
agitated.
[The witness searched among the articles in Court
taken from the laboratory, and found some large
fish-hooks, formed into grapples, with cords attach
ed, and said they were found in Dr Webster’s priv
ate room.
I found them on Friday night, and took them on
Saturday. They were rolled up in a paper, and
were laid on a shelf. There was a ball of twine
therealso. [Mr. Bemis showed him a sinker, which
he said was found with them.] The witness looked
at some skeleton keys, among the articles in court.—
All th se keys, except one, were found in Dr. Web
ster’s private room, in a drawer, tied up together.
When Dr. Webster was brought into the Police
Court, said I, “ Dr. Webster, I have found some
keys in your room.” “What,” said he, “those
that were filed ? I picked them up in Fruit street,
and threw them in there.”
Cross Examined, I went to the Medical College on
Friday, the day of the discovery, and asked” Mr.
Littlefield if there was no corner in that buildin"" that
we h.id not seep. Hesaid there was no place except
Dr. W.’s. privy. I first saw these fish-hooks on
Friday evening, in Dr. Webster’s private room.
I give the exact words of the conversation at the
Jail, with Dr. Webster. I wrote them down at the
moment.
Truman M. Tyler, rope and twine manufacturer,
testified as to the different descriptions of rope and
twine. The twine found upon the remains was call
ed two threaded marline, and was used in ships, not
in stores. He pronounced the twine found upon the
hooks, and that from the thighs, one and the same
thing.
Nathaniel Waterman, tin plate worker, Bost n,
talked with Dr Webster, in his shop, on the 80th
November in relation to the appearance of Dr Park
man, when he received the money from Dr. W.
Dr. Webster said he took the money and darted
out in an unusual manner. In reply 'to a question,
Dr Webster said, energetically, and as if he was’
sure of it, “Dr Parkman did go to Cambridge.”
Charles B. Rice, —one of the Police, which went
to seaerh Dr Webster’s apartments on Tuesday
after Dr Parkman’s disappearance. The questioii
was asked if wo hud been everywhere, and the as
swer was that we had except the Dr’s privy. Noth
ing more was done. Dr Webster was present. Dr
Webster showed the way out.
Samuel Lane Jr., and Stephen B Kimball, hard
ware clerks at No 9 Dock Square, testified that Dr
Webster inquired for fiish hooks of a large size, on
Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week.
James W Edgerly and William W Mead hard
ware clerks at No 3 Union street, testified that Hr
Webster purchased several fishhooks on Friday af
ter Thanksgiving, to use ns grapples, Mr Egerly,
identified several that were shown as the hooks sold
to Dr Webster.

I Sales of Slaves. The New Orleans Cres
cent of the 9th mst., has sundry adv. rtisements, in
f reach and English, of sheriffs sales of pronertv
among which are four lots.of slaves, to wit: one lot
containing 178 slaves, men, women and children
ranging from two years old to mature a""e; eno of
lUione of 54; undone, of 157. They are to be
sold without reserve, to the highest bidder—together
four hundred and ninety-three persons, some of
them infants, to be sold in New Orleans market
We know of few things more revolting to a citizen
of the North than one of these slave sale in New Or
leans. There are various slave auction rooms in
different parts of the city, and the human beings to
be disposed of are generally arranged like so many
horses or cows, on the pavement outside the door of
the budding— each dressed up in new coarse clothes
and with a bundle under the arm—to set him or her
oft to the best advantage. They are knocked off
to the highest bidder, like so many sticks of timber
—warranted to be sound—and their good parts and
qualities are given with as much particularity and
nonchalance as those of a horse—which has its mouth
pulled open for the purpose of displaying its teeth
A superb horse, however, will generally bring more
than a good slave—and it costs considerably more to
take care of the former than of the latter. Lowell
Journal.
Daniel YVebster. Mr. Webster, in his re
cent “great speech” in the Senate said,among other
wonderful things, that—
‘‘lie would not vote for any re-enactment of the
will of God. He would put into it no Wilmot pro
viso, nothing that was so useless and nugatorv.”
There is just about as much common sense' in this
argument as in. the eighteen column speech of
Gen. Cass, proving the unconstitutionality of the
proviso. Mr. Webster “will not vote for any re
enactment of the will of God.” The laws which
punish murder, and theft, and perjury, are nothin""
more than “re-enactments” of God’s revealed will”
hs will as written out in the Code, from which
Blackstone says ‘all other lawsderive their validity ’
reads thus: “Thou shalt not kill—thou shaft not
steal—thou shalt not bear false witness,” &c. Jlr
Webster goes against the “re-enactment” of these
commands from the statutes of the Great Law-giver
And now what will, he vote for? lie has likewise
enlightened us on that subject. lie will vote for .Mr
Mason “compromise” bill—he will vote to give up
the vast Territories of our country to the Slave pow
er—he will vote for more “efficient laws” for catch
ing runaway slaves—vote against the abolition of
slavery in the District of Columbia. And thus we
think he has marked out for himself a course which
he can safely pursue without having any fears of vot
ing for any “re-enactment of the will of God.”

Ploughing by Steam. The Banffshire,
Journal states that a patent for a steam plough has
been taken out by the inventor, Mr. James Usher
the firm off sher & Co., of Edinburgh, and that the
machine will shortly be before the public. 'Thema
chine is constructed to plough six furrows at once
thus doing the work and saving the expense of six
double horse ploughs. The great weight of the ma
chine, which is estimated at three tons, may be
thought an objection; but this is in a great degree
obviated by the use of a large roller, which is so
placed m the centre as to balance the machine and
prevent the wheels sinking. The cost of the entire
apparatus is estimated at .£3OO.
Arrival of the Crescent City The

WEOXESDAY, Air 1. 1850.
DANIEL WEBSTER.
The cottonocracy of Boston and its vicinity is now
making a desperate effort, to secure and make perma
nent, that ascendancy over the whig party of Massa
chusetts, which it partially obtained in the canvass ot
1848. Its interests and its feelings arc identified w ith
the slave power, and Daniel Webster, of whom this
clique have long been the “retainers,” at their biddmg,
has taken his recent stand on the side of slavery, and
now conies back to Massachusetts, to aid in forcing
these doctrines upon the party, niaugre all their former
professions in favor ofhuman liberty, and political right.
He arrived in Boston on Monday afternoon, and a large
bodv of the “retainers” met him and publicly w elcomed
him', iu front of the Revere House. A congratulatory
speech was made, on the occasion, by B. R. Curtis —
next to Webster the ablest man of the party in the State.
In Webster’s reply, he sustained the course indicated
by him in his recent speech—denounced the deep feel
ing of the people of Massachusetts on the question of
the surrender es fugitive slaves, as prejudice? w hich it
was their duty to overcome, and said that the question
was whether old Massachusetts would stand to the
truth, [as he expounds it] against temptation and
against her own PREJUDICES. This was the question
he was determined to ask her. He had taken his po
sition and should take no step backward. He had under
taken to restore peace and bring back the. government, Jo
such a position that it could act for the good of the
country.
Thus it will be seen that there is to lie no flinching.
The demands of the slave holders are all to be compli
ed with. The Whigs of Massachusetts have got to
sustain their policy and become their slave-catchers, or
else break away f. orn the 1 * lers of the party. The cold
blooded and heartless manner in which M ebster sets
at naught all the generous impulses of nature, all the
convictions of moral right, on these questions, is abso
lutely appalling, and tells but a sad stor. fir hmntin in
tellect, when not under the control of the higher senti
ments of our nature. The question is asked, hundreds
of times every day, whether the party w ill follow Web
ster's lead. The impression is a prevailing one, that it
will. It will make a show, in some quarters, of resist
ance, just for effect, but will gradually come into the
traces, just as it did into an acquiescence with the nom
ination of Gen. Taylor. Since the demoralization
which that act brought upon the party, there seems to
lie no stopping place for it, short of utter and degrading
subserviency to the most outrageous system of human
bondage, that ever disgraced the annals of our race.—
We do not speak at random on this subject. The ea
gerness with which the party crowded around Daniel,
to welcome him back, after the humiliating position in
which he had placed himself and the party; the char
acter of the men who were active in the matter, and
the tone of the Whig press of the State, with some
trifling exceptions, all show that the party is ready for
any degradation, and that the depth of its degradation
w ill be measured only by the requisitions of its masters.
Sad as this may appear, who will say that it is not
strictly true.
We speak of course, of the party as a party —as a
unit or inass. Exceptions there may be, and probably
will lie, among ins members. Let us see whether it will
lie so, or not. Let ns see how much moral principle
and moral courage there is left among them. Let us
see whether they will rise above the character of trad
ing, truckling, shuffling politicians, such as Daniel
Webster has proved himself to be; and whether they
have enough of feeling and principle left to vindicate
their characters as citizens, and boast of Liberty, Jus
tice, and Right.
TJJE FOURTH DISTRICT.
In view of the alarming state of affairs at Washing
ton, with the probability that the Senate is prepared to
yield up the territories to Slavery, and to pass most ob
noxious laws for the reclamation of fugitive slaves, and
that the House is so nearly balanced on these questions,
that one vote may turn the scale in favor of freedom or
against it, it becomes of immense importance that the
vacancy in the fourth district should be immediately
filled, and filled by one who will sustain the views of
Massachusetts.
The Whigs profess to be ardent friends of free soil,
and determined opponents to the extension of slavery,
and some of their leading organs in this State have re
cently expressed much alarm at the aspect of things in
relation to these questions. If they are sincere, if they
wish to sustain the principles they profess, if they de
sire to arrest the spread of slavery and the growth of
the slave power, if they are not prepared to y ield every
thing to the demands of Foote, Toombs, and their co
adjutors, how should they act in such a crisis! The
The course they have thus far pursued, has prevented
an election, and deprived Massachusetts of her rightful
representation, weight, and influence, in Congress. If
they persist in that course, the same result will proba
bly continue to follow their efforts. Why, then, should
they persist in it. John Gorham Palfrey, one
of the ablest and purest men in the State, is a candi
date fu tile office. He has held it with distinguished
reputation to himself and the Slate. He was elected,
in part, by the votes of the Whigs of the district. Is
he not as worthy of their votes now as then! No one
will say that he is not. If, then, the same men who
thus aided to elect him before, will vote for him now,
or, even if they will omit to nominate any candidate in
opposition to him, he will most assuredly be elected.
The sincerity of these men, then, in favor of free
dom, will be put to the test, in the approaching elec
tion. If they shall support the eloquent Palfrey, or
omit to oppose him, they will, to that extent, justify the
claims they make on that score. But, il they continue
to do, in this crisis of our affairs ax they have done
hitherto, they will stand self convicted of duplicity,
and show themselves the ready and willing tools of the
slave power.
We hope that our friends in the fourth district, will
do what they can to secure an election, and M|reciaUy,
that they will press home upon all who profess the
principles of free soil, their obligation to sustain the
candidate of freedom, and to see that Massachusetts is <
fully represented on the floor of Congress. If an elec- i
lion is tuudc at the ensuing trial, tire representative | ■
I may have it in his power to determine the question on
I the right side. At any rate, if no election shall be
made, the district w ill fail in the duty it owes to itself,
, to the country, and to the sacred cause of Liberty.
W e publish below the resolves concerning
the slavery question, which have passed the Legisla
ture of this State w ith a unanimity almost unparal
leled. In the Senate there were only four dissent
ing votes, and in the House the resolutions were en
grossed by a unanimous vote. They speak the sen- '
timents of the people of Massachusetts :
H hereas, The people of Massachusetts, acting
under a solemn sense of duty, have deliberately and
repeatedly avowed their purpose to resist the exten
sion of slavery into the national territories, or the
admission of new slave States into the Union, and
for these ends, to apply, in every practical mode,
the principles of the ordinance of 1787; also, to seal
the abolition of slavery and the slave trade in the
District ot Columbia, and the withdrawal of the
pow er and influence of the general government from
the support ot slavery, so far as the sapie may be
constitutionally done ; and whereas, the important
question now before the country, make it desirable
that these convictions should be reaflimed : There
fore—
Resolved, That the people of Massachusetts earn
estly insist upon the application, by Congress, of the
ordinance ol 1787, w ith all possible sanctions and
solemnities of law, to the territorial possessions es
the Luion, in all parts of the continent, and for all
coming time.
Resolved, That the people of Massachusetts cher
ish the Union with unabated attachrrtent; that they
will support the Constitution ; that appreciating the
inestimable benefits flowing from it, they believe it
better for all parties and sections, with reference to
any existing evils, to wait and work patiently under
and through the Constitution, than to destroy it, and
they have no doubt that they hold these sentiments
in common w ith overwhelming majorities of the peo
ple of these United States ; but, in any event they
will follow their principles, deterred by no threats of
disunion, and no fear of consequences.
Resolved, That the integrity and permanence of
American power on the Pacific Ocean, the increase
of our commerce and wealth, the extension of our
institutions, and the cause of human freedom on this
continent, require the immediate admission of Cali
fornia into this Union, with her present Constitution,
without reference to any other question or measure
whatever.
Resolved, That the sentiments of the people of
Massachusetts, as expressed in their legal enact
ments, in relation to the delivering up of fugitive
slaves, remain unchanged ; and, inasmuch as the
legislation necessary to give effect to the clause of
the Constitution, relating to this subject, is within
the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress, we hold it to
be the duty of that body to pass such laws only, in
regard thereto, as will be sustained by the public
sentiment of the free States, where such laws are to
be enforced, and which shall especially secure to al]
persons, whose surrender may be claimed, as hav
ing escaped from labor and service in othet States,
the right of having the validity of such claim deter
mined by a jury in the State where such claim is
made.
Resolved, That the people of Massachusetts, in
the maintenance of these, their well known and in
vincible principles, expect that all their officers and
representatives will adhere to them, at all times, on
all occasions, and under all circumstances.
Resolved, That his Excellency the Governor be
requested to transmit a copy of these resolutions to
each ot the Senators and Representatives of Massa
chusetts, in the Congress of the United States.
The Germanians have given two concerts in the
City Hall, and were warmly greeted by large and dis
criminating audiences. They went through their per
formance with, if possible, a greater degree of taste,
skill and precision than they exhibited during their first
sojourn among us. We wish all our citizens would
hear them. The following extract is from a Baltimore
paper, and shows the estimation in which they are held
in that city:
Their final concert this evening, was a truly gratifv
ing scene. As each lady entered the door, she receiv
ed a handsomely printed sheet of the “Adieu Pol
ka,” composed for the occasion by the talented and
enterprising Agent, as a souvenir to 'the Baltimore la
dies. But the ladies had been beforehand; for when
the members arrived at the hall, they found a basket, so
forwarded as to baffle discovery of the doners, contain
ing a boquet of flowers, and a fine gold pencil for each of
the twenty-three members of the. society.
When Mr. Helmsmuller at the close, expressed the
the thanks of the association for their favorable recep
tion, he was greeted with enthusiastic and prolonged
applause, and they retired amid the regrets of the audi
ence. However, we confidently expect their return in
autumn, since four ladies, acknowlegnd as leaders of
the ton, have accepted the offices of Honorary Pres
ident, Corresponding Secretary, Director anl Treasurer
to the association, for the purpose of arranging fortheir
return —and two thousand dollars have already n been sub
scribed towards next winter’s concerts.
The Germania Society give their third concert this
V ednesday evening, and we can safely promise the au
dience a musical treat of the highest kind.
The New York Herald thinks there is a cat
rolled up in the meal of the Nicaragua treaty, and that
while the British government agree to relinquish their
right to the possessions in the Mosquito country, Mr.
Clayton, by a certain construction, binds our govern
ment to give up all the rights of annexing Cuba, St.
Domingo or Canada, or acquiring any more territory
by a war with Mexico. This result is not expressed—
it is tin inference from its curious proceedings.
Ihe Cleveland 1 rue Democrat, extra, of the
29th, says the steamer Anthony Wayne, from Sandusky,
blew up opposite Vermilion. She had 54 passengers,
which with the crew, made the number of persons on
Imard 81. 19 ol the crew and 30 passengers were sav

ing, 35 to 40. The Wayne was un old Imat, and did
not belono to the regular line of Buffalo ami Sandusky
steamers. She was owned Charles Howard,of Detroit,
and was insured for 10,000.

440 passengers, most of whom will be trail, lirred at
Havana to the steamship Falcon, for Chagrcs.

SPEECH OU MH. WEBSTER,
in the barouche, at tire Revere House, to his Boston
“retainers,” on Monday, 29th April.
After the noise had in some measure subsided, he
proceeded to say that it was with great pleasure that
he met so large an assemblage of his friends at a
time when his private affairs had called him from the
seat of government to his own home. As you have
said, sir,—said lie—the duties of the winter in the
public councils of the country have been arduous.—
1 am sorry to say that those arduous duties are not
done with. lam sorry to say that the public affairs
of the country have not yet made so much progress
towards satisfactory adjustment, as to remove all the
anxiety which has been felt about the adjustment of
the subjects under discussion. But I feel authorized
to say that there is now reason to hope,—reason to
expect—that further reflection, that a generous com
parison of various wishes where we disagree, will
bring about that improved state of public feeling ;—
in the reproduction of which all our expectations of
useful discharge of public duty, all our expectations
of useful legislation, must depend.
I cannot but feci, sir, that I stand in the presence
of my friends. 1 must regard this gathering as the
personal tribute of your welcome to me. You do
not welcome the politician, and this is not an oppor
tunity for discussing those questions which now agi
tate the community and the government:—questions
which can leave little repose in the mind of any in
telligent man, till he can see some probability that
from their discussion an adjustment may come, in
favor of the prosperity, peace, happiness and con
tinued union of the country. [Cheers.]
Gentlemen, I have felt it my duty, on a late occa
sion, to make an effort to bring about some ameliora
tion ol that excited feeling on this subject which per
vades the people of the country everywhere—north
and south : —to make an effort also to restore the
government to its proper capacity for discharging the
proper business of the country. [Cheers] Fornow
let me say, it is unable to discharge that, business.
That it may regain that capacity, there is a neces
sity for effort both in Congress and out of Congress.
Neither you nor I shall see the legislation of the «oun
try proceed in the old harmonious way, until the dis
cussions in Congress and out of Congress upon the
subject to which you have alluded, shall be in some
way suppressed. Take that truth home with you :
—and take it as truth ! —Until something can be done
to allay the feeling now separating me i and different
sections,there can be no useful and satisfactory legis
lation in the two Houses of Congress.
Mr. Curtis, and gentlemen; the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts h is done me the honor to place me as
her representative—as one of her representatives
in Congress. I have believed that she would approve
in me, any honest, cautious, and sincere effort to al
lay the dissension which we see among the people of
the country, and to restore Congress to its constitu
tional capacity for action. I have believed that the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts would support her
representatives in that course. I have believed that
a general sentiment of the whole country would fivor
and encourage their efforts in it; and I’have the sat
isfaction now to believe, that, in that belief, I shall
not be disappointed. [Cheers.] However that may
be, that effort I shill repeat. [Renewed cheering.]
In that course of pacification 1 shall persevere, re
gardless of all personal consequences. [l’hree cheers.]
I shall minister to no local prejudices. I shall sup
port no agitations having their foundations in unreal,
ghostly abstractions. [Laughter and cheers.] 1
shall say nothing which may foster the unkind pas
sions, separating the North from the South. May
my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, before it
may utter any sentiment which shall increase the
agitation in the public mind on such a subject.—
[Cheers.]
bir, 1 have said that this is not an occasion for po
litical discussion. I confess that if the time and cir
cumstances gave an opportunity, I should not be in
disposed to address the people of -Massachusetts di
rectly upon the duty which the present exigency ol
atlairs has devolved upon her—this great and glori
ous commonwealth 1 Upon the duty at least, which
it devolves upon us, who represent her in the Nation
al Legislature. This will not be such an opportu
nity. I shall have an occasion, in my seat in the
Senate, to which I shall immediately return, to give
my opinions upon some topics of an interesting char
acter—topics, in regard to some of which, there ex
ists both mis-statement and misapprehension; the,
greatest mis-statement; the greatest misapprehen
sion, especially so far as I am concerned. I may
simply mention of these. It is the question respect
ing the delivery of fugitives from service. With re
gard to that question, there exist the greatest preju
dices; the greatest misapprehensi ms. Ido not won
der at these misapprehensions. I am welt aware
that this is a topic which must excite prejudice. 1
can very well feel what the prejudices are, which it
must very naturally bring up in the minds of the good
people of this commonwealth. But, Mr. Curtis and
gentlemen, there are in regard to that topic, duties
absolutely incumbent on the commonwealth; duties
imposed by the Constitution; absolutely incumbent
on every person who holds office in Massachusetts
under her own constitution and laws, or under those
ol the nation. She is bound, and those persons are
hound to the discharge of a duty; of a disagreeable
duty. We call upon her to discharge that duty as
an affair of high morals and high principles. We
show to her—and \ve mean her, and ask her to re
solve upon the performance oi duty, though it be a
disagreeable duty. Any man can perform unagree
able duty; it is not every man who can perform a
disagreeable duty. Any man can do what is alto
gether pleasant. The question now is whether Mas
sachusetts,—whether the old State of Massachusetts,
— improved by two centuries of civilization, re
nowned for her intellectual character, —mighty in
her moral power,—conspicuous before the world,
a leading State in this country, ever since it was
a country—a leading State in the Union, ever since
it was a Union; —the question is, whether Massa
chusetts will shrink fiom or will come up to a fair
and reasonable and moderate performance (and no
more than a fair and reasonable and moderate per
formance) of her sworn obligations.
I think she will. (Cheers.)
Sir, the question is, whether Massachusetts will
stand to tho truth, against temptation I Whether
she will be just, against temptation! Whether she
will defend herself against her own prejudices! She
has conquered every thing else in her time; she has
conquered this ocean which washes her shore; she has
conquered her own sterile soil; she has wered
her stern and inflexible climate; she has fought her
way to the universal respect of the world; she has
conquered everybody’s prejudices but her own —
J he queaton now is, whether she will conquer her
own prejudices ! 1 shall return to the Senate, to nut
that question to her, in the presence of that common
mother, who shall deal it to her heart. (Cheers.)
In the meantime, let me repeat that I tread no
step backwards. (Cheers.) j am devoted to the
restoration of peace, harmony mid concord out of
Congress;—and such a degree of mutual co opera
tion in Congress us may enable it to carry on once
more the legitimate business of the government.
Tho Union flu the preservation of which I strive ;
tho Inion of States for which 1 strive ;—is not mcn-
|ly a union of law, —of constitution, —of compact;—
but while it is that, it is a union of brotherly regard,
—of fraternal feeling throughout the whole country.
I do not wish that any portion of the people of this
country shall feel held together only by the bonds of
. a legal corporation; bonds which some of them may'
' think restrain their limbs, —cramp their affections,—
I gall and wound them. I wish, on the contrary, that
they shall be bound together by those unseen, soft,
easy sitting chains that result from generous affec
tions, and from a sense of common interest and com
mon pride. In short, fellow-citizens, my desire is,
and my labor is, to see that state of things produced,
in which, filling all bosoms with gratilude, all hearts
w ' t hj°y> illuminating all faces, spreading through all
ranks of people, whether rich or poor, whether North,
South, East or \\ est; —there shall exists the balm of
all our suffering; the solace of all our political calam
ities; the great security of every thing prosperous,
and great, and glorious, in the future;—and that is,
THE UNITED LOVE OF A UNITED GOVERN
MENT.
CONGRESS.
The Senate, Tuesday, talked about the Polar
Expedition and the Public Printing, and passed a bill
authorizing the negotiation of Treaties with the In
dians South and West of the Missouri River.
The House agreed to make the proposition giv
ing Bounty Lands to Soldies in all our wars a special
order forder for the third Tuesday in June.
Mr. Went work of II 1 , got in a searching resolu
tion of inquiry with regard to the Printing of Con
gress; and if Speaker Cobb gives him a good Com
mittee, this inquiry will amount to somethin"".
—Then followed a debate on the Census bill,
wheKiijto Slavery wants to infuse ju much darkness
as possible. Two more days be was
ted on this, after which the bill will probably passes
it came from the Senate.
Later from California. The N. Y. Sun
has received from its correspondent at Yera Cruz,
advices from California to the 9th inst. These ac
counts state that the markets continued dull, goods
ot all kinds being plenty.
I he rainy season had not completely passed over,
and was preventing the transportation of provisions
to the mines. Provisions, consequently, were very
scarce, and the miners were reported to be suffering
severely. °
The winter had been severe and prolonged in the
remote places, and it was feared that from the scar
city of food much sickness might ensue among the
miners in some sections.
Gold is said to be found in greater abundance than
ever, and heavy quantities have been lately worked
out. The continuance of the rainy season has pre
vented the gold being brought down to San Francis
co, for shipment home or to exchange for the neces
saries of life; but the merchants were anticipating
better times as soon as spring had fairly set in. °
A Private Claim. A press in Washington,
which has been conspicuous for its attacks upon the
Cabinet, on account of the allowance of certain pri
vate claims, will have an opportunity of displaying
before the country its own disinterestedness in the
matter of charges against the government. The
correspondent of the N. Y. Evening Post gives the
following account of this affair:
Tho resolution of Mr. Hale, adopted a few weeks
ago, directing an inquiry to be made into a little
transaction, whereby the proprietors of the Union
establishment appear to have pocketed the sum of
twelve thousand and five hundred dollars for printing
under the order of the Senate, a pamphlet of one
hundred and eighty-one pages, has received a great
deal of comment. The circumstances of this case
invest it with profound interest, and lead us to in
quire with anxious solicitude, what are we coming

According to Mr. Hale, five or six hundred dollars
would have been a liberal compensation. The work
was done during the recess of the Senate, and the
accounts were audited and paid, by Mr. Secretary
' Dickins. The original charge is said to have been
$40,000, which, however, under the advocacy of a
rather notorious than distinguished Senator, was
compromised down to $12,500, or nearly ten times
what it should have been. While the negotiations
for this arrangement were in progress, it is reported
that a referee was appointed to decide between the
public treasury and the printers, and that said re
feree happened to be a person not altogether disin
terested in the premises.
Fhe Boston Post says that the following toast
was given at a public meeting by a whig in Bristol
county, and thinks that the gentlemen alluded to are
meh good farmers that they can scarcely fail to appro,

treaty and a portion of the correspondence; but de
clines publishing it. It says, “the treaty lavs the
foundation of a complete revolution in the commerce
of Ithe world, and also by its ambiguity, sows the
seeds of a great conflict between the United Slates
and England, which will surpass anything of the
kirn winch has ever taken place in the history of
the human race! For the present the terms of treaty

a late census of England, the number ofhorses in That
country has been found to have diminished from 1 .
000,000 to 200,000 within the last two years—in other
words, the railroads have dispensed with the use of
800,000 herses. and these animals, as well as oxen
are now scarcely used for transporting; and thus the
grain and food which the 800,000 horses formerly
consumed, have been dispensed with, and the land
used for the growth of hay andgrassjis devoted to the
growth of grain alone, for the supply of bread.

PATENTS.
American and Foreign Office.
Agency for Business with U. S. Paten
Office, WASHINGTON.
No. 22 State Street—BOSTON.
IN 1840 the subscriber was appointed by the Com
missioner of Patents Agent of the ILS. Patent Office,
in accordance with the 10th Sec. of Act of 1837.
Having relinquished the Agency for transmission of
Models, and adopted a more expeditious mode of send
ing them to tire Patent Office, whereby a Patent may
be pi ocured about s(x weeks earlier; he continues to
forward them free of expense—to prepare Caveats, Spec
ifications, Assignments, and all the necessary Papers and
Drawings for Patents; and to render advice on legal and
scientific matters respecting the same. Pate, secured
in Europe ana other countries.
Byapplictavi t this office, inventors are saved the
time and cost of a ,< urney to Washington, and delay
there, as well as all person>• 1 trouble, in obtaining their
patents. They also have the advantage of verbally ex
plaining their inventions, and of consulting in respect
to them; Hitters, in general, of paramount importance
in order to obtain correct specifications and claims.
The experience of sixteen years’ practice, an extensive
collection of rare works, decisions, etc., on mechanical
subjects, the Patent Laws, and Patents o* different
countries, collected at much expense during Ihe long
time this Office has been established, together with
accounts here kept of inventions patented at Washing
ton, enable the subscriber to afford to inventors, desirous
of procuring Patents, assistance and information which
in other respects might be diffic -It of attainment.
R. H. EDDY, {Solicitor of Patents-
Washington, July ‘4l. 184-9. During the
time I iccupied the Office of Commissioner of Patents,
R. 11. Eddy, Esq., of Boston, did business at the Patent
Office as Solicitor for procuring Patents. There were
few, if any, pci-mis acting in that capacity, vho had so
much business Ik ! <»re the Patent Ooi * •. mid there were
none who conducted it with more skill, fidelity and suc
cess. I regard Mr Eddy ns one of the best informed and
most skilful Patent Sblicitoi in the I nited States, and
have no hesitation in assuring inventors that they can
not employ a person more competent and trustworthy,
and more capable of putting their applications in a form
to secure for them an early and favorably considea
tion at the Patent Office.

SPEECH OF
Hon. Charles Sumner,
OF MASSACHUSETTS,
ON Ills MOTION
To Repeal the Fugitive Slave Bill,
In the Senate of the U. States, Aug. 26, 1852.
If any man thinks that the intervst of these Na ions
"" e .‘“''jest of Ghristianity are two separate and
distinct things, I wish my son] may never enter into his
Bei ' re G Oliver Cromwell.
Concluded
Learn now from the Diary of John Adems the re
suits of this system:
Ihe year 17(i5 hiu been Ihe most, re markable
jearof niy hie. 1 hat enormous engine .fabricated
by the British Parliament, for batteringdown all
rights and liberties of America—l mean the Stamp
Act—ims rai-ed and spread through the whole con
-IWIH to our h OOOI,
ri® K e "" era!i °ns. In every Colony from
l ° Ne a V Ham l ,9hlre mclusivelv, the stamp
dis nbul.rsnnd inspectors have been compelled
by the unconquerable rage of -he people to re
nounce then offices. Such and ao uniieraal has
been the resentment of the people, that everyman
who has dared to speak m fiivoi of the stamps, or
to soften the de’estation in which they are held
how great soever his abilities and virtues had been
esteemed before, or whatever bis fortune, connec
tione, and influence had been, has been seen to sink
into universal contempt and ignominy.”
The Stamp Act became a dead letter. At the
meeting of Parliament numerous petitions were
presented, calling for its instant repeal. Franklin,
at that time in England, while giving bis famous
testimony before the House of Commons, was ask
ed whether he thought the people ol’America would
submit to this Act if modified. His brief emphatic
response was: ‘-No, never, unless compelled bv
force of arms.” Chatham, yet weak with disease,
but mighty in eloquence, exclaimed in ever memo
rable words:-‘We are told America is obstinate—
America is almost in open rebellion. Sir, 1 rejoice
that America has resisted. Three millions of peo
ple so dead to all the feelings of liberty, as volun
tarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit
instruinems to have made slaves es ali the rest —
The Americans have been wronged; they have been
driven to madness, f will beg leave to tell the
House in a few words what is really my opinion.—
It is that the Stamp Act be repealed, absolutely,
totally and immediately.” It was repealed. With
in 1< ss than a year from its original passage de
nounced and discredited, it was driven from the
Statute Book. In the charnel house of history,
with the unclean things of the past, it now rots.—
Thither the Slave Act is destined to follow.
Sir, regarding the Stamp Act candidly and cau
tiouHy. free from the animosities of the time, it is
impossible not to see that, though gravely uncon
stitutional, it was at most an infringement of civil
liberty only; not of persona! liberty. There was an
unjust tax of a few pence, witli the chances of
amercements by a single judge without a jury; but
by no provision of this Act was the p rsonal liberty
of any man assailed Under it no freeman could
be seized as a slave. Such an act though justly
obnoxious to every lover of constitutional liberty
cannot be viewed with the feelings of repugnance
enkindled by a statute, which assails the personal
liberty of every man.and under which any freeman
may be se zed as a slave. Sir, in placing the Stamp
Act by the side of the Slave Act, Ido injustice to
that emanation of British tyranny Both, indeed,
infringe important rights; one of propertv; the oth
er the vital right of all, which is to other"" rights as
the soul to the body—the right of man to himself.
Both are condemned; but their relative condemna-
i?? a ®.''_ red by lheir
the dollar that he earns; as Heaven,'to which we
all aspire, is higher than the earth, where every
accumulation of Wealth must ever remain; so are
the rights assailed by an American Congress higher
than those once assailed by the British Parliament.
And just in this degree must history condemn the
Slave Act more than the Stamp Act.
Sir, 1 might h re stop. It is enough in this place
and on this oecasion, to show the unconsitutional
itv of this enactment. Your duty commences at
once. All legislation hostile to the fundamental
law of the land should be repealed without delay.
But the argument is not yet exhausted. Even if
this Act could claim any validity or apology under
the Constitution, which it cannot, it lacks that es
sential support of the public conscience of the
States, where it is to be enforced, which is the life
of all law, and without which any law must become
a dead letter.
The Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Butler)
was right, when, at the beginning of the session,
he pointedly said that a law which could be enforc
ed only by the bayonet, was no law. Sir, it is idle
to suppose that an act of Congres becomes effec
tive merely by compliance with the forms of leg
islation. Something more is necessary. The Act
must be in harmony with the prevailing public sen
timent of the community upon which it bears. Of
course, I do not suggest that the cordial support of
every man or of every small locality is necassary;
but I do mean that the public feelings, the public
convictions, the public conscience, must not be
touched, wounded, lacerated, by every endeavor to
enforce it. With all these it must be so far in har
mony, that, liko other laws, by which property,
liberty, and life, are guarded, it may be administer
ed by the ordinary process of the courts, without
jeoparding the public peace or shocking good men.
If this be true as a general lule—if the public sup
port and sympathy be essential to the life of all law
this is especially the case in an enactment which
concerns the important and sensitive rights of
personal liberty. In conformity with this principle
the Legislature of Massaehusetta, by fmmal reso
lution, in 1850 with singular unanimily,declared:
“We hold it to be the duty of Congress to pass
such laws only in regard thereto as will be main
tained by the sentiments of the Freq States,where
such laws are to be enforced.”
The duty of consulting these sentiments was re
cognized by Washington. While President of the
United States, at the close of his administration,
he sought to recover a slave, who had lied to New
Hampshire. His autograph letter to Mr Whipple,
the Collector of Portsmouth, dated at Philadelphia,
Nov. 28th, 179 G, which 1 now hold in my hand, and
which has never before seen the light, after de
scribing the fugitive, and particularly expressing
the desire of “her mistress.” Mrs Washington, for
her return, employs the following decisive lan
guage:
•‘I do not mean, however, by this request, that
such violent measures should be used as would ex
cite a mob or riot, which might be the rase if she
has adherents, or even uneasy sensations in the
mi ds of well disposed citizens. Rather than
either of these should happen, 1 would forego her
services altogether; and the example also, which
is of intinitel) more importance.”
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
Mr Whipple, in his reply, dated at Portsmouth,
Dec. 22. 1796, an autograph copy of which I have,
recognises the rule of vt ashingtun:
“1 will now, sir, agreeably to your desire? send
her to Alexandria, if it be practicable without the
consequences which you except—that of exciting
a riot, or a mob, or creatirg uneasy sensations in
the minds of well disposed pe'sons. The first can
not be calculated beforehand; it will be governed
by the popular opinion of the moment, or the cir
cumstances that may arise in the transaction. The
latter may be sought into and judged ol by con
versing with such persons without discovering the
occasion. So far as I have had opportunity. I per
ceive that different sentimenu are entertained on
, this subject ” .
VLIIM BtlllJUUt.
The fugitive never was returned., but lived in
freedom to a good old age, dowir to a very recent
period, n monument of the just forbearance of him
whom we aptly call the Father of his Country. It
is true that he sought her return. This we must
regret, and find its apol »gy Be was at the time a
slaveholder. Though often with rarions degrees
of force expressing himself against slavery, and
promising his suffrage for its abolition, he did not
see this wrong as he saw it at the close of life, in
the illumination of another sphere. From this act
of Washington, still swayed by the policy of the
world, 1 appeal to YAshington writing his will —
[PKICE ONE CENT.
From Washington on earth, I appeal to Washin
ton in Heaven. Seek not by his name tojusti
any such effort. His death is above his life. His
last testament cancels his authority as a slavehold
er. However he may have appeared before man,
he came into the presence of God only as the lib
erator of his slaves. Grateful for this example, I
am pratetul also, that while a slaveholder, and
seeking the return of a fugitive, he has left in per
manent record, a rule of conduct which, if adopted
by his country, will make slave hunting impossible.
The chances ofa riot or mob, or even ‘uneasy sen
sations among well disposed persons,” are to pre
vent any such pursuit.
Sir, the existing Slave Act cannot be enforced,
without violating the precep r ot Wash ngton. Not
merely sensations of well disposed per
sons,” but rage, tumult, commotion, mob, riot, vio
lence, death, gush from its fatal, overflowing feun
tains.
hoc fonte derivata clades
in pat ri am populumque fluxit.
Not a case occurs without endangering the pub
lic peace. Workmen are brutally dragged from
employments to which they are wedded by years
of successful labor; husbands are ravished from
wives, and parents front chlldre’. F.verywhere
there is disturbance; at Detroit, Buffalo, Harris
burgh, Syracuse. Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
At Buffalo the fugitive was cruelly knocked by a
log of wood against a red-hot stove, and his mock
trial commenced while the blood still oozed from
his wounded head. At Syracuse, he was rescued
by a sudden mob; so also at Boston At Harns
burgh, the fugitive was shot; at Christiana, the
slave hunter was shot. At New \ ork. unprece
dented excitement always with uncertain conse
quences, has attended ev.ry case. Again at Bos- .
ton, a fugitive, according to the received report,
was first basely seized, under pretext that be was a
criminal, arreted only after a desperate stmale,
guarded bv officers who acted in violation of the
laws of Ihe State, tried in a Court House surround
ed by chains, contrary to the common law. and
finally surrendered to davery, by trampling on the
ctiminal pr cess of the State, under an escort m
violation again of the laws of the state, while the
pulpits trembled and ihe whole people, not merely
“uneasy” but. swelling with ill suppressed indig.
nation,'for the sake o{order and tranquillity, with
out violence, witnessed the shameful cat istrophe.
With every attempt to administer the Slave Act,
it constantly becomes more revolting, particularly
in its influence on Ihe agents it enlists. 1 itch can.
not bo touched without defilement, and a.l who
lend themselves to this work, seem at nice and
unconsciously, to lose the better pari oi man Ihe
spirit of the l.iw pisses into them, as the dptils en
tered the swine. Upstart commissi, m rx. the mere
mushrooms of courts, vic and revie with i-aeh oth
er. Now by indecent speed, now by i.irshnesx of
manner, now by a denial ot evidence, now by crip
pling the defence, and now by open glaring wrong,
they make the odious Act yet more odious Clem
ency, grace, and justice, die in i>s presence. All
this is observed bv the world. Not a case occurs
which does not harrow the souls of good men, and
bring tears of sympathy to the eyes, also those oth
er tears which “patriots shed o’er dying laws.

peculiar class It is a sorry fact that le m

The Stale laws of Massachusetts have beer mo
lated in the seizure of a fugitive slave; ui
like that of Revel, now hangs at Boston.
I have said, sir, that this sentiment is just, .ma
is it not? Every escape from slavery necessarily
and instinctively awakens the regard ot all who
love freedom. The endeavor, though unsuccess
ful. rsveils courage, manhood, character. No sto
ry is read with more interest than that of our own
Lafayette, when, aided by a gallant South Caroli
nian, in defiance of the des; otic ordinances of
Austria, kindred to our Slave Act, he strove to es
cape from the bondage of Olmutz. Literature
pauses with exultation over the struggles of Cer
vantes, the great Spaniard, while aslave in Algiers,
to regain the liberty for which he says, in his im
mortal work, ‘we ought to risk life itself, slavery
being the greatest evil that can fall to the lot of
man.” Science, in all her manifold triumphs,
throbs with pride and delight, that Arago, the
astronomer and philosopher, a devoted republican
also, was redeemed from barbarous slavery, to be
come one of her greatest sons. Religion rejoices
serenely, with joy unspeakable, in the final escape
of Vincent de Paul. Exposed in the public square
of Tunis, to the traffickers in human flesh, this il
lustrious Frenchman was subjected to every viie
ness of treatment, like a I orse. compelled to open
his mouth, to show his teeth, to trot, to run, to ex
hibit his strength in lifting bnrlhens, and then, like
a horse, legally sola in market overt. Passing from
master to master, after a protracted servitude, he
achieved his freedom, and regaining France, com
menced that resplendent career of charity, by
which he is placed among the great names of
Christendom. Princes and orators have lavished
panegyrics upon this fugitive slave; and the Catho
lic Church, in homage to his extraordinary virtues,
has introduced him into the company of saints.
Less by genius or eminent services, than by suf
ferings, are the fugitive slaves of our country now
commended. For them every sentiment of hu
manity is aroused.
“Who could refrain
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make his love known!”
Rude and ignorant they may he, but tn their
verv efforts for F reedoni, they Claim Kindred witn
all that is nobl. in the pas'.. They are among the
heroes of our age. Romance has no stones or
l more lAirdllng interest than theirs. Classical an
tiquity has preserved no examples of adveuturous
trial more worthy of renown. Am mg them are
men whose names will be treasured in the annals
of their race. By the eloquent voice, they have
done much to make their wrongs known, and tn
accuie the respect of the world. History will
soon lend them her avenging pen. Proscribed by
you during life, they will proscribe Jou through all

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, ’SB.
The Kania, Baltic in
The victory obtained by th® opponents of the
Lecompton swindle, in the House, on Monday,
in carrying Mr. Harris’s resolution, by four ma
jority, cannot but animate the breast of every
friend of freedom and the right, with sensations
of the highest delight. It is an opening of the
great Kanzas battle, which prognosticates a sure
defeat of the infamous Lecompton villainy, if its
opponents shall have the constancy to persist in
their determination to stave it off.
Mr. Harris’s resolution (or rather Mr Harris’s
amendment of the resolution of Mr. Hughes,
Democrat, of Indiana,) was in the following
words:
“Resolved, That the message of the President
enclosing the constitution framed at Lecompton,
in the territory of Kanzas, by a convention of del
egates thereof, and the papers accompanying the
same, be referred to a select committee of fifteen,
to be appointed by the Speaker, and that said
committee be instructed to inquire into all the
facts connected with the formation of said con
stitution and the laws under which the same
was originated, and into all such f .cts and pro
ceedings as have transpired since the formation
of said constitution having r< lation to the ques
tion of the propriety of the admission of said ter
ritory into the Union under said constitution, and
whether the same is acceptable and satisfactory to
a majority of the legal voters of Kanzas, and that
said committee have power to send for persons
and papers.”
The passage of this, by parliamentary usage,
from a fair Speaker (and such, it is believed, is
Mr. Orr), insures a committee, consisting of
eight anti-Lecompton men, to seven for the Ad
ministration. It is ardently hoped that the com
mittee will be so constructed as not to detract
from the reputation for honor and fairness which
Speaker Orr has hitherto maintained —prompted
and sustained as he would be in such a course by
the example of his immediate predecessor, as
presiding officer of the House.
The Senate, it has been seen, defeated Mr
Douglas’s resolution by five majori’y. Only two
other Democrats (Broderick of California and
Stuart of Michigan) came to his res ue on the test
vote. So there would seem to be no prospect of
getting through that branch any investigating
resolution of the character of the one which has
passed the House. Yet, as it requires the con
current vote of both branches to admit a State
into the Union, the Lecompton concoction may
be oonsideted, from the action of the House, as
dead. When that measure shall fail through the
disagreement of both Houses, the great struggle
will be on the admission of Kanzas with a con
stitution framed by a new convention, which will
easily go through the House, and most go through
the Senate, or that body will stand responsible
for the keeping out of another State, fairly enti
tled to admission into the Union, according to
all precedent and all the.past doctrines and pro
fessions of Democracy, and the principles of
"" popular sovereignty.”
The vote by which Mr. Harris’s resolution
passed the House, was 115 to 111. Among the
yeas, besides the Republicans, were 22 Democrats
from the free States, as follows:
Haskin of New York; Chapman, Dewart.
Hickman, Owen Jones, and Montgomery, o 1
Pennsylvania ; Adrian of New Jersey; Cockerell.
Cox, Groesback, L. W. Hall, Pendleton, and
Lawrence, of Ohio ; J. G. Davis, English, Foley,
and Hughes, of Indiana; Harris, Morris, Mar
shall, Shaw, and Smith, of Illinois ; and McKib
ben of California.
Two from slave States, viz :—F. P. Blair, Jr.,
of Missouri, Republican, and Henry Winter Da
vis, American, of Maryland, voted in the affirm'
ative.
The 29 Democrats from the free States, who
voted in the negative, should be remembered by
their constituents, as they doubtless will be.
2of these 29, we are ashamed to say, are from
New England, viz :—Arnold and Bishop of Con
necticut. 11 of them are from New York and 8
from Pennsylvania, but we are rejoiced to per
ceive only 2 from Ohio, 3 from Indiana, and none
from Illinois or any other of the Northwestern
States. So much for the irfluence of Mr. Doug
las in bis own section. 2of the remaining 3, of
these 29 miscreants, hail from New Jersey, and 1
from California. Let them all be marked.
The absentees were 6 in number, as follows;—
Matteson of New York, Republican ; Leidy and
Reilly of Pennsylvania, Democrats ; Harris of
Maryland, and Caruthers of Kissouri, Ameri
cans ; and Bonham of South Carolina, Democrat.
Tne Speaker did not vote.
Slavery Agitation. —All accounts agree in
representing the anti Lecompton meeting at
Philadelphia, on Monday evening, as a large and
influential assemblage of the Democracy ot that
city. The following extract from one of the res
olutions adopted on that occasion shows in the
most unmistakable manner the temper and dis
position of the meeting;
Reeolved, That we declare it to be our unsha
ken determination to resist every attempt to force
upon the people of a territory any constitution
which has not had their express approval, con
scious as we are that resistance to aggression is
the only means by which unparalleled wrongs
can be redressed.
Rewlved, That as State Rights Democrats,
jealous of any infraction of this wholesome doc
trine, we shall oppose every attempt to interfere
with the sovereignty of the States, either North
or South, or with the people of the territories,
seeking admission into this Union—the sole guide
of the latter being found in the express terms of
the Kansas-Nebraska act—and the action of the
former resident in the inherent right to make, al
ter, or abolish their constitutions in the way pre
scribed by the citizens of the individual States.
Allusions to the Pennsylvania Democrats in
Congress who sustain the President, were re
ceived with groans, and when the announcement
was made of the defeat of the Lecomptonites in
the House, by the passage of the motion of Mr-
Harris, there was immense applause. This agi
tation of the subject in popular assemblies, so
well begun in Philadelphia, is to be followed by
other meetings of the Democracy of other parts of
the country, and a call has already been issued for
a meeting of the anti-Lecompton Democrats, in
New York city, on Friday evening.
A Voice from the Southern Democracy.
The Southern Democrats cannot be unanimously
resolved to fasten the Lecompton constitution
upon Kanzas when one of their organs, the Lou
isville Democrat, uses uses such noble language
as this:
“We cannot but regard the proposition to force
Kansas into the Union with the Lecompton
constitution as the most extraordinary ever made
since the formation of the federal constitution.
Events as they transpire expose its monstrosity
more and more. Is it not plain to every one that
the constitution is distasteful to the vast majority
of the people of Kansas ? Can any one now pre
tend to think it is not ? And is it true that any
considerable number of Congressmen will really,
in the face of the facts, attempt to impose a con
stitution upon a people that they utterly repudi
ate ?
The Territorial Legislature protests against it;
the people at the ballot box protest against it. It
is a document sent to Congress by a small minor
ity that have no power in the territory ; and it is
proposed that it shall be accepted by Congress as
the constitution, in spite of all remonstrance. We
don't knowhow to reason with a man taking such
a position. It is hardly worth while to remind
him that this is a free country, and that it is
not be governed by force. In the midst of the
movement, it is loudly proclaimed that a people
have a right to frame their institutions in their
own way; and can change or modify their con
stitution to suit themselves. The doctrine is prac
tically denied, while it is ostentatiously pro
claimed.
The people of Kanzas now proclaim, in every
possible way in which they can speak, that they
renounce and denounce this Lecompton consti
tution. They new claim the right to slter it,
or make a constitution to suit themselves ; and
yet Congress, heedless of these protests, propose
to declare that this condemed document shall be
ths constitution of the Stats. Mark it, no good

is to come of this extraordinary deed, if it be ac
complished.”
In speaking of this singular course of the
Southern secessionists on this question, the Dem
ocrat makes the following home-thrust :
'•The extreme South propose to lead in this act
of despotism in regard to a Slate. Have they all
forgotten that right of peaceable secession they
have been wont to magnify so much ? They now
propose the exercise of it themselves, if this con
stitution is not forced upon an unwilling people.
Well, cant Kanzas exercise it, tot And what,
then, will they have to say ? Suppose Kanzas,
proclaimed by Congress a sovereign State, se
cedes from the Union, and declares independence?
How will they look, about that time, at the ap
plication of their own theory ?
L Alabama must go out of the Union because
Kanzas is not taken into the Union, may not the
new S'ate, for a better reason, secede from the
Union, when that Union has forced upon them a
constitution they despise ? When treating of
Kanzas, State rights seem to be ignored altogeth
er} and popular rights equally eondemed.”
The Congressional Affray.—The Wash
ington correspondent of the New York Tribune
has the following description of the melee in the
House, on Saturday morning:
‘•Mr. Grow, who stood his ground firmly, was
instantly surrounded by a ling of Southern mem
bers, all apparently and some really attacking
him. Conspicuous among them were Messrs.
Davis, Barksdale, and Lamar. Supposing that
the whole group were attacking M;. Grow, Mr.
Potter of Wisconsin dashed among them, dealing
heavy blows on all sides, and receiving some
very severe ones in his face and on various
parts of his person. Washburne of Illinois at the
same moment sprang over chairs and desks to
Mr. Grow’s assistance, followed by his brother
of Wisconsin, by Tappan of New Hampshire,
and other Republicans. The Southern members
thus furiously assailed, of course defended them
selves, and some who entered the arena as peace
makers left it as combatants. The battle was se
vere while it lasted and revealed a very unexpect
ed readiness for fight among the Northern men.
Mr. Davis, and the other Southern members
whe were engaged in the fight, came ovt-r and
conversed with their opponents in a frank and
courteous manner during the rest of the night
session; and certainly if the Southern members
are content with their share of the transaction,
the Northern members have no reason to be
ashamed of theirs.
As seen from'the Reporters’ Gallery, it present
ed a droll enough spectacle There were some
fifty middle-aged and elderly gentlemen pitching
into each other like so many Tippeiery sava
ges—most of them incapable, from want of wind
and muscle, of doing each other any serious hurt.
Mr. Barksdale of Mississippi, who waa among the
most active, encountered at one moment Mr. Pot
ter of Wisconsin, who was decidedly the champi
on of the ring. Putter grasped Barksdale by the
hair, with the evident intention of putting that
gentleman’s head into chancery. To his unutter
able surprise and disappointment, the hair came
off. The Mississippian was scalped. Ue jumped
about bald -headed, making frantic efforts to re
cover his wig, which Potter had disdainfully toss
ed among the crowd, some one of whom kindly
restored it to its proper owner.
Everybody is praising the promptness and vigor
with which Messrs. Potter and Washburne of
Wisconsin, ahd Washburne of Illinois, dashed in
to the excited crowd of Southerners and rushed to
Grow’s aid. The Southhrn men who were in the
fight declare that they found them very ugly cus
tomers. They are all natives of Maine.
A Southern senator remarked, yesterday, that
the Republicans had gained the first bettle, since
they drew the first blood (Kcitt’s) and got the
first scalp (Barksdale’s wig.)”
The correspondent of the Courier and Enquirer
thus accounts for the rush of the ""brave allies,”
and narrates the consequences :
“ Of course, as the melee was sudden and gen
eral, no member could understand the intentions
of any other. In fact, the presumption from the
beginning was that the attack upon Mr. Grow
was premeditated, like the outrage upon Mr.
Sumner, and Republicans were seized with a de
sire to punish Keitt. Had the ruffian been found
after the beginning of the disturbance, he would
have been severely handled. Mr. Barksdale was
collaring Mr. Washburne of Illinois; seeing this,
C. C. Washburne of Wisconsin bore up to the
relief of his brother. Mr. Lamar of Georgia
ranged up by the side of Mr. Barksdale, and Mr.
Poster opaued in artistic style on the whole, mis
taking Mr Washburne of Illinois for the enemy.
Mr. Potter saluted him roughly on coming into
action; but, correcting himself, charged upon
Mr. Barksdale’s wig with one hand and his coun
tenance with the other. Mr. Barksdale received
two-severe blows, but whether from Mr. Pottei or
Mr C. C. Washburne cannot be determined. Mr.
Potter was thrown off his balance by Mr. Barks
dale’s wig coming off and remaining in his hand,
and his blows probably failed of their object.
Mr. Potter was slightly marked under the left eye
and Mr. C. C. Washburne had his thumb sprain
ed; Mr. Washburne of Illinois also had his
throat compressed Mr. Lamar, it is stated, drew
his penknife, but with what purpose cannot be
known. When Mr. Davis of Mississippi felt
himself struck in the face, he drew a weapon in
self-defence, but quickly replaced it.
Mr Mott of Ohio, a Quaker member much re
spected, and Rev. Owen Lovejoy of Illinois, were
thickly engaged, shoving, holding, choking, and
crowding friends and enemies by turns, as peace
makers. ”
Mr. Grow of Pensylvania, who floored the
chivalrous Mr. Keitt of South Carolina, on Mon
day night, is a native of Windham county, Conn.,
and represents at the present time the congres
sional district of Pennsylvania which was so long
and so ably represented by Hon. David Wilmot.

in regatd to its facts. In the first place, I would s»ate
some of the circumstances leading to the event, that it
may be better understood. The yuung man who was bap

condition, in reference to (he life to corner and in order to
understand for himself, he began to read the ""Word of
God,” and as he read, became much interested—so much
so that in one evening he would read the life of the Sa
vior as recorded by one Evangelist, and the second even
ing another, nuiil he was convinced that the Lcr! had
provided for him a Savior. How to beco ue a partaker
of that salvation, was Lh next inquiry. On the evening
referred to, he came to the house of the young man who
baptized him, (who himself has been a ‘ to 'lower of

The Iron Ores of Wisconsin, and the
Coal Fields of Illinois A recent report
of Prof. Daniels, btate Geologist of Wiscon
sin, gives some interesting tacts relative to
the iron deposits of that State. These depos
its are found, first, in beds or veins in the
rocks where they were originally formed or
introduced ; second, deposited from aqueous
solutions in low ground, as bog ore are very
numerous in the swamps and marshes of the
State, but none have been discovered of suffi
cient value to be profitably worked. Of ihe
rock deposits, the most important is that at
Black river falls, in Jackson county. About
two miles above the village the bed is eigh
teen feet thick.
The ore lies in bands of massive hematite
from six to forty feet in width. Near this is
also a heavy deposit of black oxide, highly
magnetic. Small veins of specular iron ore
are alsn seen. It is estimated that on one
side of the river, there are 15,000,000 tons of
available iron, and on the other 28,000,000
tons. At Iron Ridge in Dodge county, is
another extensive deposit. The company
working it are estimated to have 13,612,500
tons of available iron at tiieir command.—
Another large bed of ore is located in the
towns of Hartford and Depere, in Washing,
ton county. In the town of Marston, Sauk
county, is a bed of brown hematite, from ten
to twenty feet in thickness.
Prof Daniels aslo gives the result of an exam
ination of the coal fields of Northern Illinoin,
made for the object of ascertaining their avail
ability in working the iron mines of Wiscon
sin. He says that the coal district st La Salle,
on the Illinois river, is from twelve to eigh
teen miles in diameter, and contains not less
than 150,000,000 tons of coal. The deposit
consists of three seams, one seven feet, one
five feet, and one three to four feet thick.
The material resources of the Northwest are
indeed astonishing.

Congressional.-— Washington, Feb. B.—
Mr. speaker Orr will not be prepared to an
nounce the names of the committee of fifteen,
as called for by the resolution of Mr Harris,
until tomorrow. The majority will be men
opposed to the admission of Kanzas under
the Lecompton Constitution. In forming the
committee, the Sneaker will be governed by
that rule of parliamentary action which re
quires that the avowed enemies of a measure
should not be appointed to determine upon
its merits. The committee will be announced
probably on Wednesday.
Mr. Hughes of Indiana, will probably be
chairman of the select committee, as he offer
ed the original proposition for such a commit
tee. The committee will be a fair one in ev
ery respect. The South is evidently disposed
to btick down in the matter of secession. The
most positive assurances were given this morn
ing, that if Harris's resolution passed, three
States would certainly secede, but the fire
eaters take the result very meekly thus far.
The probability that Lecompton will yet pass
in spite of transient defeat today, tends to
kee-p them quiet.
.The scanty majority in the House against it,
and the significant votes in the Senate of
Messrs. Bell, Crittenden, Houston, and Ken
nedy, foreshadow a pro-slavery victory in the
final struggle.
Destruction of Liquors.—At their an

it was unfit for the purpose. They then re
solved to destroy it, and appointed Thursday
to execute the vote, but here a new difficulty
awaited them. Upon trial it was found that
the stuff would not burn ! Finally, they pro
cured some pure alcohol at the agency, and
succeeded in igniting the fluid. The ques

committee chosen for the purpose of devising
means to secure a proper observance of the
day employed an agent to collect statistics of
Sabbath violations in the city. The number
of shops, &c., which weie found open on one
Sabbath are the following : restaurants 437 ;
pawnbroker’s shops 26 ; policy and exchange
offices 34; daguerrian galleries 55 ; confec
tionary and segar stores 1,234 ; Sabbath con
certs 18; dance houses and places of amuse
ment 85 ; dry goods and kindred stores 2,419 ;
groceries 1,777 ; liquor shops and drinking
saloons 3,408; making a total of 9.692 places
of business and amusement engaged in their
ordinary and mostly destructive traffic on the
Sabbath, or about one place to every 65 of
the entire population. If the average be es
timated at 20 of the frequenters and custom
ers of those concerns, it will make nearly
200,000 of the population, who may be class
ed as Sabbath-breakers, and patrons of Sab
bath-breakers. Various causes are assigned
for this desecration, the most prominent of
which is the large emigration from lands
where the Sabbath is a gay holiday, or where
it is so overlaid by fast and feast days of hu
man appointment, as to be practically super
seded in the respect and observance of the
people.
W HEBE THB CaNABY BlliOS CoME FbOM.—
There is an association in Philadelphia com
posed of about thirty Germans, who aim at
improving the breed of canary birds ; and
last month they published their 13th annuaf
report. From that it appears that the bird
sales of Philadelphia are confined to Ger
mans, and amount to $40,600 annually, and
three quarters of that are canaries. The com
mon or original canary is of the least value,
and sell at about $2 apiece; the improved
kinds bring from $8 to $lO apiece, and are
from Central Europe. The great majority of
these birds were obtained from Belgium,
where they are bred in houses by the peas
ants, who raise them as a pastime. There
are what are called “ long” and "" short”
breeds. Birds of the long breed are procured
from Brussels, Antwerp and Dietz, where
they sometimes obtain extravagant prices.—
Their cost depends upon the color and shape,
the pure golden yellow being the most es
teemed. Ihey are only used tor the purpose
of breeding, and oftentimes sell for S3O a
pair. The short breed is raised by the peo
ple of the Harz mountains. Next to the
Belgian the French bird is most prized.
An Incident of the late Pbbsidential
Election.—l heard not long ago, from a
friend, an incident of the last Presidential
campaign, which I have not seen in print,
but which is too good to be lost. I give it
from a memory which does not profess to be
exact in quotation of conversation, but its
substantial accuracy 1 can vouch for.
Imagine, then, a group in the porch of a
country tavern, m the Eastern part of Tennes
see. They are discussing the merits and
chances of the several candidates for the
Presidency, and passing from that topic, by a
sort ot fatal gravitation, to the question of
slavery and its conflict with freedom in the
coming peiiods of our history. The conver
sation is interlarded with explanations-of no
dubious character which 1 omit in deference to
the clerical traveller who stands ""lakin'
notes.""
A Fillmore voter directs his harangue to a
couple of Democrats, who are as wide awake
as lie to the vexed question which is agitating
the land—and so runs his discourse :
""1 believe that we are bound to go down,
sooner or later, in this fight on niggers.""
“What’s that? How so ?""
“Just as I say—we are bound to go down.
Those fellows at the North are the strongest.
We’ve got no chance. They can out-vote us,
and if it comes to the worst they can out-fight
us. They are fifteen millions to our seven—
and no fools nor cowards either. We can
give them a good tussle, in a fair fight—but
we’ve got no chance with fifteen millions of
men in iront, and three millions ot niggers
behind. I tell you there's no reckoning for
us—we lire bound to go down.”
"" We'll get help from over the water.""
“Where? England is against us—France
is against us—the civilized world ia against us,
except the Spaniards. They are kith and kin
with us. and a precious help they would bo.
There isn’t a decent nation on the globe to
give us a lift. The public opinion of the
world is against us. More than all that, God
Almighty is against us, and the Lord Jesus
Christ is against us. There's nobody to tight
with us, or for us, except those infernal
Spaniards and the Devil.”
“ Why don't you give up, then, aud go for
abolition ?”
“No, I won’t. The niggers are ours. No
body has aisy right to meddle with them, but
we will hold on to them ns long as we can
aud light it out: bul 1 tell you, we are bound
to go down.”
This incident speaks for itseii, and is a
good story, at any rate. Perhaps it gives a
glimpse of the working of more minds than
one, in and out of Tennessee.— CoV. of Boston

CONGRESS.
Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 9.
SENATE.
Mr. Douglas moved to postpone the Army
bill, in order to take up his Rauzas resolution
calling for returns of the Kanzas election.
The motion was lost—yeas 23, nays 30.
Mr. Douglas, from the Committee ou For
eign Relations, reported a resolution granting
authority to the President to settle the diffi
culties with Paraguay. Ordered to be print
ed.
Mr. Dixon in committee, commenced a re
ply to the speeches of Mr. Toombs and oth
ers, on the Kanzas and slavery question.
Mr. Pugh advocated Mr. Douglas’s motion
to postpone the army bill, but voted against
the postponement, after making an explana
tion.
Mr. Mason said that when Mr. Douglas’s
resolution was called up, if not previously
tabled, it would lead to a very long debate,
and if adopted, its effect would be to transfer
to the halls of Congress, ihe excitement now
existing in Kanzas. He would, therefore,
when it came up, move to lay it on the table
as a test question, on the ground that it is not
a proper subject for the consideration of the
Senate.
Mr. Dixon replied to Messrs. Toombs and
others, on the subject of Kanzas and slavery.
In the course of his remarks, he alluded to
the President’s Silliman letter, embodying the
professor as a peer of the highest mind in
the scientific world, and as having obtained
an eminence, which, if the President himself
should ever reach, he might well be satisfied.
Mr. Foot was opposed to .an increase of the
army and even thought it might be reduced
without detriment to the country. As to
the Utah troubles, he would withdraw the
troops already. there, and recall the govern
ment officers, leaving the Mormons to the
fate of their own vices and delusions. If it
was the intention to send these troops to Kan
sas, the proposed increase would fail in num
ber far below what would be required. If
against the Indians on the frontier he would
rather protect them from their white aggres
sors.
Mr. Foote continued at some length in a
similar strain, closing with the remark, that
in the absence of a foreign war, in the absence
of internal discord, and in the presence of im
pending national bankruptcy, he thought it
would best aubseive the interests of the coun
try to vote against the bill in all its parts.
Mr. Pugh said if the gentleman would
bring in a bill reducing both the Anny and
Navy, he would vote for it.
Mr. Benjamin opposed the bill. The ex
pense of the proposed increase would amount
to $14,000,000. He’would support the Ad
ministration in any reasonable measure, but
Lot in such a measure as this.
Mr. Hamlin opposed the bill. He would
not vote a dollar to send troops to Kanzas or
Utah. He would never sanction, by his vote,
an executive war. He would leave the Mor
mons to their fate.
Mr. Wilson got the floor, and the Senate
adjourned.
HOUSE.
A resolution was adopted, suthorizing the
committee appointed to investigate the ac
counts and official conduct of the late door
keeper of the House, to extend their inquiry
into ihe official conduct of the present door
keeper.
Mr. J. Glancey Jones, from the Committee
on Ways and Means, reported an appropria
tion to enable the President to carry out the
Sound dues treaty.
A bill was passed appropriating SBO,OOO for
the expense of running the boundary line of
the United States and the State of Texas.
On motion of Mr. Haskins, a resolution
was adopted providing for the appointment of
a special commitlee to investigate the facts
connected with ti e sale of a tract of land at
Wilkinson’s Point, N. Y., as a site for a gov
ernment fortification, with power to send for
persons and papers.
The remainder of the day was devoted to
calling upon the States for bills and resolu
tions on various subjects.

Lt. Louis, Feb. 9.—The Leavenworth cor
respondent of the Democrat says that a bill
providing for a constitution has passed the
Kanzas Legislature.
Lawrence letters, in the Leavenwoith pa
pers, contain the proceedings of the Board of
Commissioners to investigate the election
McLean, the chief clerk in the Sur
veyor General’s office, testified to having sent
the returns of both elections to Platt city, at
Calhoun s request—that he bad not seen
them since ; and that the Delaware Crossing
returns had never been received at Lecomp
ton. Ihis was doubted, and Sheriff Walker
was despatched to Lecompton to search Cal
houn’s office, and found, buried in ihe ground
* under a wood-pile, the identical returns
which McLean swore to having sent to Platt
city. Gov. Denver, the Speaker of the
House, and the President of the Senate, ex
amined him, and he swore that they were the
same returns that Calhoun counted on the
14th ult.; that the Delaware Crossing returns
were tfmong them, footing up three hundred
and forty-nine votes. Previous to this, Dif
fendore had testified to having given the
Delaware Crossing returns to Calhoun aj
Weston, subsequent to the count at Lecomp
ton. It was said that evidence would be pro
duced of his preventing Calhoun from having
the returns, wheu he counted the other votes.
Writs had been issued for McLean and
Sherwood, who had fled to escape arrest.
Arrival of the U. 8. Sloop of-War St.

New York, Feb. 9.—The U. 8. sloop-of
vtar St. Louis, J. W. Livingston, commander,
arrived at this port this evening, in thirty-two
days from Porto Braza, Cape de Verds.
The St. Louis has been absent twenty-seven
months on the Afsican station. She brings
home the crew of the whale ship Pocahontas,
wrecked Oct. 30 on the Isle of Brava, with a
number of other distressed American seamen;
also the invalids of the squadron.
Fight between Firemen and Students.
New Haven, Feb. 9.—A sad affair occur
red here at half-past six o’clock this evening.
William Miles, foreman of Hose Company No.
2, whose engine house is in the rear of the
colleges, was shot by a student, whose name
is not yet publicly known. The student, in
a moment after, was badly hurt by h fireman.
Iwo or three students and as many firemen
then engaged in the fight, and the clothes of
one of the latter was badly cut by a knife, but
no wounds were given. Three shots were
fired, two of which are supposed to have
lodged in the left side of Miles, and hi« re
covery is very doubtful. He is only about
twenty years old. There had been a disturb
ance between the parties for some days, such
as shooting by the students, and throwing
water by the firemen. There is much excite
ment, and a row is threatened.
Beautiful Extract.—Nature’s seed time
is solemnized beneath the vaulted cathedral
sky ; silent dews, and gentle showers, and
kindly sunshine, shed their sweet influence
on the teeming noil; springing verdure clothes
the plain; golden wavelets, driven by the
West wind, run over the joyous wheat-field;
the tall maize flaunts in her crisp leaves and
nodding tassels. While we restand while we
move, while we wake and while wo sleep,
God’s chemistry, which we cannot see, goes
on beneath the clouds ; myriads and myriads
of vital colls ferment with elemental life;
germ and stalk, and leaf and flower, and silk
and tassel, and grain and fruit, grow up from
the common earth ; the mowing machine and
the reaper—muta rivals of human industry—
perform their gladsome tusk ; the woll-pded
wagon brings home the ripened treasures of
the year; the bow of promise fulfilled simns
the foreground of the picture, and the gra

A bill was reported to incorporate the Chel
sea Beach Horse Railroad Company.
The resolve and article of amendment of
the constitution providing for the abolition of
the Governor’s Council was passed by the
Senate, after some debate, by a vote of 24 to 8.
Another bill in relation to the publication
of petitions was introduced in the Senate ns

HOUSE.
A bill making some additional appropria
tions was reported.
The House appointed a Committee of sCgd

An order was introduced by Mr. Morrill of
Fall River, and adopted, requesting the
Treasurer to furnish a statement of the in
vestments of the loan sinking fund of the
Western Railroad. It is whispered that some
portion of this sinking fund has been involv

Scientific Intelligence.
Prof. Silliman has pronounced the recent
Canada invention for printing bank notes so
that they cannot be photographed, entirely
successful. The method is simply the use of
two permanent and opaque inks, both of
which are indelible and insoluble. The one
is a black carbon ink, in which the engrav
ings of a bank note are usually printed, and
the other is a natural green ink, for tinting
the surface of the note, which is produced
directly from the sesqui oxide of chromium.
The discovery of a light-colored ink, possess
ing die same qualities as the well-known
black ink, whose basis is carbon is certainly
an important event. And if these two inks,
when united on a bank note, have no photo
graphic contrast—if they are permanent in
their color, and, as Professor Silliman says,
unchangeable by anything which the chem
ist has at Iris disposal—then the new method
is certainly one of decided value. This opin
ion will however, be seriously qualified, if
the announcement that colored photographs
have been recently taken in Paris and.at Bos
ton should prove true. The Boston Trans
cript testifies to the reality of the colored pho
tograhs taken by Jesse Harding of Cam
bridgeport, in which the colors of blue, green
and purple are produced beyond question.
The incrustations of boilers, which consti
tutes one of the chief defects of steam en

it passes into the boiler, is purified of its
salts and foreign particles.
Artificial ear-drums are now made of fine
silver wire with a disc of India rubber or gut
ta percha between. They aie placed in the

is said the effect is magical.
A French discovery for rendering wood
and cloth incombustible was lately tried be
fore the emperor. Ladies’ di esses of the
most gauzy material that had been prepared
with it, could not be made to burn. A cot
tage, one half of which had been covered
with the preparation, was filled with straw
and set on fire. Half the building was con
sumed, but when the flames reached the pro
tected portion, they died away without injur
ing it.
A new process for imitating the skins of
animals upon fulled cloth produces a very
beautiful article. I’he cloths are printed be
fore they are dressed, and the nap is then
raised and dressed in the usual manner, thus
producing all the delicate shading of the nat
ural fur.
Mr. Garcia, a Louisiana sugar refiner, has
brought before the academy of sciences at
Paris, a process for clarifying sugar with soap.
Ihe same soap is used over repeatedly, and
there is said to be less waste of sugar and a
more perfect article than by the old methods.
Mr. Mene, a French chemist, has discovergd
an application of hydrate of alumina for the
same purpose.
M. Regazzali, an Italian, has originated
a method of impelling railway trains up steep
ascents. A cylinder having on its circum
ference two helices, forming a double thread
ed screw, is placed under and parallel to the
axis of the boiler. This screw cylinder is set
in motion by the engine, and it gears with a
series of horizontal pulleys placed between
the line of rails, which pulleys act as a left
handed screw, and in this manner the train
is wormed up the incline.
Ihe New Haven Palladium, a few days
since, was printed upon paper made of ivory
shavings. It was pure and white, but rather
too hard and elastic for printing purposes.
For writing or card paper we would suppose
it might answer a very good purpose.—The
Mechanics’ Journal recommends pure croton
oil as a lubricator for machinery ; it does not
' clog from viscidity and is free from acid, while
it remains in place and requires to be applied
less frequently than other oils.
A machine has been introduced for the man
ufacture of Minie rifle balls, which will turn

Psyllography is the name of a new branch of
art that has recently acquired great develop
ment in Paris. It consists simply in cuttii g
out sheets of black paper in such a way as to
make it into a picture—figures or landscapes—
which has all the finish of an engraving by
the best masters. It appears that psyllo
graphy is a German discovery, its Columbus
being one Herr Schmidt, who, armed with a
pair of scissors and a sheet of paper, is able
to reproduce the most complicated landscape.
A member of the academic of sciences of
Paris, who is also an eminent chemist, has
invented an aparatus which he thinks will
enable human beings to breath as freely at
the bottom of the sea as on the surface of the
earth. He proposes to form an association
for collecting all the treasures now lying at
the bottom of the ocean, and estimates at
about £800,000,000 sterling the harvest of
treasure to be gleaned on the route between
England and India only.

BY TELEGRAPH
TO THE WORCESTER DAILY SPY
TWO DAYS
LATER FROM EUROPE.
BY THE EUROPA.
The steamship Europa was at Halifax Sun
day morning. She brings news of the death
of Macauley, the historian, and various politi
cal items oi general interest, which we give
below :—
That Pamphlet and the Congress-
It was reported in Paris that Austria, Na
ples and Spain would not send plenipotentia
ries to the Congress unless the Pope was repre
sented. The Russian ambassador has declared
to Walewski, that the pamphlet, “The Pope
and the Congress,” contains principles opposed
to the respect for authority on which the Rus
sian government is founded, and consequently
Russia will oppose the programme drawn up
in the pamphlet. Walewski is reported to
have declared to the diplomatic corps, that as
long as he was minister for foreign affairs, the
pamphlet should not be considered as the pro
gramme of the French ministry.
Austrian journals were engaged in denounc
ing the pamphlet; and the Vienna Gazette re
gards it as a direct menace tor Austria. It is
nevertheless averred that in government cir
cles the pamphlet has not produced a disagree
able impression, the government being con
vinced that the opinions therein expressed are
fwt entertained by the Emperor Napoleon.
She London Post publishes the following tele-
Kraphic dispatch, dated Paris 30th : “There is
Kt this moment between the Cabinets of Paris,
■Vienna and Rome, an active exchange of dis
matches, easily explained by existing circum
stances. All that is said of the unfavorable
disposition of the Court of Rome is false.
Monsignor Saccom awaits instructions.—
Khere is many grounds for believing that the
re-union which is now taking place at Foun.
tainbleau, between the Emperor Prince Met
ternich and Wallewski will have the effect to
smooth down many difficulties, and hasten the
meeting of Congress.”
The French pamphlet had been translated
into Italian, and largely circulated in the Ro
magna. A despatch from Rome reports a
lengthy interview between Cardinal Antonelli
and the French Ambassador. The latter had
received from Paris some explanations des
tined to reassure the Papal government on the
subject of the recent pamphlet. A Prussian
and Russian Council of Ministers have re
solved upon not giving any official denial of
the pamphlet.
Vienna letters say that Austrian statesmen
were beginning to see the impossibility of re
storing the Italian Dukes, and were almost
reconciled to the idea of a Central Italian or
ganization. The Milan Gazette announces
that the ex-Duke of Modena had advanced
with his troops toward the frontier of Modena.
Part of his army was already ata frontier
town.
From Great Britain.
Lord Macauley died on the 28th ult., at
London. He had been unwell about a fort
night, from disease of the heart, but had ral
lied to such an extent that his medical men
did not apprehend danger. The result was,
therefore, sudden and unexpected. He was
only 59 years old, and, as he was never mar

far post office money orders can be safely graft

Mr. Sebastian introduced a bill for the re
lief of the American Board of Commissioners
of Foreign Missions. Keferred.
Mr. Bigler introduced a bill for the suppres
sion of invasion of the state or territory by or
from another, the fitting out of military expe
ditions or enterprises against another, and, tor
the punishment of such offences. Referred to
a select committee.
Mr. Clingman discussed Mr. Pugh’s resolu
tions. He referred to the remark of General
Cass in 1856, in reply to an inquiry about his
health. He (Cass) said: “lam very well but
depressed in spirits. 1 used to think the
Union could never be dissolved, but now I
have painful apprehensions to the contrary.
They say Kansas creates this excitement, but
a hundred Kansas bills could never have pro
duced it. These people mean to liberate your
slaves, you may not think they are fanatics,
to ut the misfortune is they are ignorant tana
tics, you will gain nothing by making conces
sions, you cannot help ns but destroy your
selves. But if you are firm you may protect
yourselves.” —Mr. Clingman then went on to
that the abolition feeling had so spread
that it controlled nearly all the secular and
religious press of the north. He said the old
Whig party had been demoralized especially
by such men as the Senator from New York,
(Mr. Seward.) Now there was a party at the
north whose only principle was hostility to
the south, this party passed bills to evade
United States laws.
They hire men to run off the slaves of the
south by the underground railroad, and send
members to the other part of the capitol to make
speeches hostile to the south. The American
people would decide, if the question was fairly
put, that Ompipotencc had made a difference in
the negro and white man, and we must take
the fact as it is. He claims as settled that the
negro is inferor to the white man, and is bene
fitted by slavery. There were two ways to
remedy the present trade: one is to make the
north see its wrongs, or else, for the south to
be independent Two things had made the
south disunionists: one was the small vote
Mr. Filmorc had received, and the other was
the maimer in which the raid of John Brown
was received at the north. The south had no
fear of a rising of the negroes than she had
of a rising of horses. He declared that the
election of a Black Republican President
would furnish sufficient cause for a dissolution
of the Union. Ho thought that would be a
sufficient overt net. It could hardly be ex
pected that the south would wait until she was
completely in the power of her enemies.—
A Black Republican President could draw
away all the arms from the slave states,
and take such other measures as would
leave the south open to a huhdred
John Brown invasions. If the south submitted
to the election of a Black Republican Presi
dent, she would be in the same condition us an
army who surrenders at discretion, entitled
only to such terms as the victor might choose
to grant. He referred to the value of the
Union as exercising a powerful eflbet in stim
ulating liberals of Europe to contend against
monarchical and aristocratic institutions. In
tho course of his remarks, he said that south
ern men would {not recede from the capitol.
This was the last place they would ever give
up. If the Union was to be dissolved in blood
he hoped the first fruits would be reaped here.
He concluded by expressing confidence in the
good fortune of the United States, and hoped
for the prosperity of the Union.
The further consideration of the subject was
postponed till to-morrow. Adjourned.
HOUSE.
A point of order was raised on Friday, by
Mr. Leake, as to the admissibility of Mr. Pen
nington’s plurality resolution, and this morn
ing it was passed over informally.
Mr. Underwood indulged the hope that by
this debate the people of the south had been
aroused to their position in the Union, and
have become fully acquainted with the end
and aims of the enemies of the republic. It
would be neither truthful, profitable, nor just,
to speak of the Republicans otherwise than as
the abolition party, which he regarded as ut
terly unmindful of constitutional obligations.
He gave a brief history of the slavery agita
tion, “speaking, not as a southern man, but as a
citizen of the United States,” for the constitu
tion, which defends not only the preservation
of southern rights, but also those of the Union.
He maintained that it was the duty of every
citizen to aid in the execution of the fugitive
slave law; and those engaged in the under
ground railroad operations, were land pirates,’
and as foul a crew as was ever on board a ship.
This republican, or abolition party, had faith
fully followed the advice of Mr. Seward, who
proclaimed the higher law against the lives
and interests of the south. In the course of
his remarks, he said he wanted a united south,
for the south to demand nothing to which they
were not entitled. While divided, they were
a prey to factions. This was not the time to
form a new party, when the republicans en
danger the Union. No man at the south is
willing to dissolve the confederacy, unless
their rights are disregarded, and the constitu
tion violated. Let the cry be, “justice and
the constitution.” Let there be a union of true
men, the true men of the south with the true
men of the north, for the preservation of that
instrument. The democratic party is the only
hope of the country.
Mr. Hill, on explanation, said there were
many gentlemen in political life, who, though
now co-operating with the Republicans, do not
cordially sympathise with them. A union par
ty was proposed, based on attachment to the
government, and the enforcement of all laws.
Would it be a national misfortune to make
such a division of the Republican party ?
Mr. Underwood wished to know what ev
dence he had that any portion of the Repub
licans would join the new party.
Mr. Hill replied that a portion of the gen
tlemen who were elected on the people’s ticket
had shown their nationality by voting for Mr.
Gilmer. He hoped this class of men would
unite with the union party, and separate them
selves from the Republicans.
Mr. Underwood responded to this by
saying that they showed they were sectional
men, by voting first for Mr. Grow’ and then
for Mr. Sherman, many times. He would tell
his colleague that at no time or place, nor un
der any circumstances, would he trust the
rights of his constituents in the hands of
Thaddeus Stevens. Neither would he go into
political association with him.
Mr. Hill wished to know whether his
colleague would spurn affiliation with John
Cochrane, of the Buffalo platform.
Mr. Underwood replied that Mr. Coch
rane, who was absent, could speak for himself.
Mr. Hill—ls he would held you to a Dem
ocratic majority, very well.
Mr. Underwood replied that he would not
break down the constitutional party at the
North to make a new party.
Mr. Hill, in further explanation, said the
new party was predicated on the good sense of
the American people.
Mr. Underwood contended that the South
were as patriotic as the Pennsylvania mem
bers. He eulogized the Democratic party,
and commented upon the conduct of the
Southern opposition, in their voting for
Speaker. No reason had been given why
those twenty-three gentlemen did not vote for
the Democratic nominee.
Mr. Larrabee, who, with others, partici
pated in the incidental debate, asked Mr. Hill
whether he entertained proscriptive principles
against foreign born citizens, or on account of
certain religious opinions.
Mr. Hill replied that he had not changed
a sentiment since 1841. He had ever thought
that, intelligence being equal, he wouid always
vote for a native, in preference to a man born
on foreign soil. (Applause.)
Mr. Larrabee—Then 1 and the gentle
man are as wide apart as the poles.
Mr. Hill—Because our constituents are.
Mr. Larrabee replied, that, although he
represented the largest naturalized constituen
cy represented in the House, he wouid vote
for a South American in preference to a re
publican.
Mr. Underwood wished to know how
many Southern Oppositionists would vote for
a Nor.h-Western or Southern Democrat.
Mr. Stokes replied that he had already
said in the contingency of having to choose
between a Republican and a Democrat, he
would vote fbr a sound conservative Demo
crat. He would not vote fbr a nominee who
is in favor of Judge Douglas with his squatter
sovereignty principles, for the Presidency.
Mr. Hatton wanted to know’ if Mr. Under
wood’s North-Western Democratic friends
were willing to vote for the protection of
slavery in the territories in the form of a stat
ute.
Mr. Underwood did not doubt they were
for the reason that the President said so, and
the Northern Democracy have never failed to
give the people of the South all the rights
they are entitled to, under the constitution.
[Applause.]
Mr. Hatton wanted further to know wheth
er they would support a man who believes
that the people in a territorial capacity, have
the right to legislate on the subject of slavery
which he regarded as a fallacy.
Mr. Underwood replied that the country
would see that the tendency of such questions
was to divide and distract the Democratic par
ty which alone could put back the wave of fa
naticism. He wanted the South to see that
the Southern Oppositionists were throwing
fire brands into the Democratic party. In con
clusion, he said he would stand or fall by what
Georgia should vindicate. He occupied the
floor nearly four hours.
Mr. Morris, of Illinois, replying to a por
tion of Mr. Underwood’s remarks, brought
the President up to his record on the territo
rial slavery question, on which he arraigned
him the other day. He repeated that the
President has abandoned his original position
and made a bid for the Southern vote in the
Charleston Convention. Adjourned.
The Talk at Washington
Whshington, Jan. 16.—The Senate, in
executive session, has confirmed the nomina
tion of Mr. Faulkner as Minister to France.
No action was taken on the motion to recon
sider the vote by which Mr. Grund was re
jected as consul to Havre. They considered
the case to be without remedy.
Hon. John Cochrane, though slowly recov
ering, is still confined by painful illness.
Various private conferences have taken
place, since Friday, among gentiemen repre
senting different parties, with a view to agree
ing upon a basis for the election of a Speak
er ; but, as heretofore, without a favorable re
sult. Several members await an opportunity
to offer propositions of a practical character,
for this purpose, among them Mr. Sickles of
New York, whose resolution provides “that
the House now' proceed to the election of
Speaker, viva voce, and, if, upon the first
call of the roll, no one shall have a majori
ty, a quorum being present, then from those
having the highest number the candidates, not
exceeding three, shall be selected, and the
House shall proceed to make a choice among
these, by a second vote; and, if neither has a
majority on the second ballot, then, from the
two highest on the list, the House will make
choice of Speaker; and also, that if, upon the
third ballot, the said two persons shall receive
an equal number of votes, the House will con
tinue to vole for one or the other of the same
two persons until one of them shall receive a
majority and be elected ; and that, until a
choice be made, there shall be no debate.”
The most that is claimed for this proposition is
that it is according to the constitutional mode
of electing a President by the House, and the
mode by which the Senate chooses a Vice
President, when the pcopls fail to elect
Indians on the Plain.
Independence, Mo., Jan. 16.—The New
Mexican mail with SanteFe dates to the 12th,
arrived here yesterday. This mail came by
the Rottam Mountain road to avoid the In
dians who are encamped on the Bear river,
some twenty-five miles off the old road. Mr.
Bent, at Bent’s Fort, informed the mail party
that the Kiowa Indians had been there to obtain
powder and lead, but were refused, and that
they threatened to destroy the Fort. Persons
gailn Spn • : glorning, lamiarg 17, IS6U.
who have been to Bear river state that there
are some four thousand lodges of Kiowas and
Camanches encamped on that stream. No In
dians wore seen on the route except some
Cheyennes who are friendly. The weather
was pleasant most of the way.
Kansas News.
Leavenworth, Kansas, Jan. 16.—The two
wings of the territorial legislature of Kansas
still remain at their respective points, the ma
jority at Lawrence, and the minority at Le
compton. An attempt io reconcile the differ
ences on the question of a temporary capital
will be made to-morrow by the introduction of
a resolution into both branches, favoring an
adjournment to Leavenworth, as a compro
mise.
Lawrence correspondeoce says that quite a
strife occurred in the organization of the two
houses of the State legislature, by the Sena
torial aspirants, Lane and Winchell entering
the field for their respective friends, in which
Lane seems to have been worsted.
The principal Republican candidates for the
Senatorship are General Pomeroy, General
Lane, James M. Winchell, Marcus J. Par
rott, H. J. Adams, J. C. Vaughan, and A.
Danforth. Pomeroy and Winchell, however,
seem to have the inside track. Lane is using
every exertion to obtain the position, but, it is
said, his betrayals of his friends are daily work
ing him great harm, and lessening his chance
for an election.
Robbing the Mail-
Warsaw, Mo., Jan. 16. —John Aymerson,
a very respectable citizen of this place, was
arrested yesterday evening, charged with pur
loining letters from the mail bags. Aymerson
was deputy postmaster, and, it seems, he has
been stealing for some time. Several pack
ages were found under a desk in the court
house, where he had deposited them to open.
It is clearly demonstrated that he would take
letters from the mail while distributing them
in the office, open them, take the contents,
then place new envelopes on the letters, di
rect them, and send them on their route.
Aymerson was a county school commissioner,
and also, deputy circuit and county clerk,
and has enjoyed the confidence of the entire
community. The prisoner started for Jeffer
son City, to day, in custody of the special
mail agent, who brought about the arrest.
Panic in New York.
New York, Jan. 16.—Rumors respecting
the insecurity of the new State Arsenal in
Seventh avenue have gained such force that
many of the soldiers refuse to attend the
stated drills there. It is said some of the life
insurance companies threatened to cancel the
policies they hold on the lives of those who
may attend those drills. The building fell
from Its own weight several months ago while
in process of erection.
A “Democratic” Veto-
Chicago, Jan. 16.—The Omaha Nebraski
an of the 10th states that the bill abolishing
slavery in Nebraska territory, which had pass
ed both houses es the Legislature, had been
vetoed by Gov. Black.
The Marine Disasters at Key West.
Charleston, Jan. 16.—The Courier’s Key
West letter reports that the marine disasters
there for the past year have involved the loss
of §3,031,000.
The Lottery Case of Swan & Co.
Savannah, Ga., Jan. 16.—The lottery case
of Swan & Co. has been decided by the Su
preme Court sustaining the points of Swan’s
counsel and reversing the decision of the lower
court against Swan.
The Missouri Legislature-
St. Louis, Jan. 14.—The Missouri legisla
ture adjourned sine die this morning. Gov.
Stewart immediately issued a proclamation
calling on the 27th February,to take action up
on the railroad bills and other unfinished busi
ness.

(Cream of Tartar Substitute.)
Just receivedbv the subscriber.
The above article is believed to be far superior to
Cream of Tartar fur cooking purposes, and much more
healthy.
Prof. HORSFORD, of Harvard College, says:
“The article, (Mazaison,) is prepared according to in
structions furnished by myself, as the result of long con
tinued experiment, and it will be produced of invariable
purity, and strength equal to that of Cream Ta.'ter.""
Dr. JACKSON, STATE ASSAYER, says:
“I have examined Prof. Horsford's Cream of Tarter
Substitute, fur bread making, and I have used it in my
family cooking, with success. This powder produces
good and light bread of a pleasant flavor and quite
white.”

E W GAS LIGHT.
JOHNSON’S
DOMESTIC SELF-GENERATING GAS LIGHT,
Invented by HENRY JOHNSON, WuNngton. D. C.
Patented April IS, 1850.
This invention will render all Families who use it inde
pendent qf Gas Companies, and how or wherever placed,
they can enjoy the luxury of a brilliant Gas light. Each
burner generates Its own gas from common Burning
Fluid, Its safety, brilliancy, cheat nets and convenience,
are admitted by all who use or see It. This mode of using
burning fluid prevents a posibility of explosion. One
pint will last from 7 to 10 hours. The average cost the
year round is one cent an hour. This light is equal In
brilliancy to the coal gas light, and at the same time is
softer and more agreeable to the eyes. The cost of the
apparatus is from $3 upwards according to style. You
can pipe off your house, as with coal gas, for 15c a foot,
or have each complete in itself, either as chandelier,
bracket, or to stand on the mantle or carry from room to
room In the hand. The same style of fixtures used for
coa 1 gas can be used. There Is no disagreeable odor.
It allow s no gas to escape as none Is made except when
burning. Its adaptation for dwellings, churches, halls,
factories, cart, steamers, and omnibuses, is unsurpassed.
Come and tee it. Night is the best time to witness its il
luminating powers. It must be seen to be appreciated.
This beautitul, cheap, and desirable domestic gas light
can now be seen at at
114 Main street, Woreester, Mass.
The subscribers having purchased the above Patent for
the State of Massachusetts, are prepared to furnish fix
tures and burners for all who may send In their orders,
Persons ccming from the country and residents of the
city are rosjwctfully Invited to call and examine for them
selves. A fair trial will satisfy any one that this self-gen
erating gas Is far cheaper and equally as brilliant as the
coal gas. Cali at 114 Main street and see specimens.

Female Regulator,
v The Greatest Remedy of the Age.
For the use of Single or Married Female s
may be justly ranked as the most suc
cessful and invaluable specific for all
derangements.obstructions, and Private
difficulties peculiar to the female sex,
now before the public. Dr. Hill, the
senior in Especial Diseases, during his
long and varied practice of Twenty
years and upwards, has made the
Delicate and Difficult Disorders
and Diseases, arising from the construe
tion and functions of the Female Svs
tem, his particular subject of attention
and study, in which department of his
practice it has been his aim to bring to
a thorough test and Issue the different
Botanic and Indian Agents of the
M .teria Medica, with the view of pro
ducinv a Convenient. Safe and Certain
Remedy for al! cases of Irregularities
Suppressions and Obstructions, and their
private cognate affections of the. female system, and the
result is the production of his
INFALLIBLE FEMALE REGULATOR.
Menstrual Compound, a prenatation which daily
experience proves to be most speedy and efficacious in
its operation, and is Warranted Harmless, and always
.successful in all cases, when used according to the direc
tions.
UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED BOTTLES!
have been sold within the last Ten Months, and the grat
•lying result has been the prompt and thorough rcstora
tion of Hundreds of Females, who have sought relict
from other preparations in vain, thereby demonstrating
its indisputable right to be styled the greatest
Female Cuiholicon «&; Regulator of the Age.
Other preparations styled ""Female Catholicon""
arc being widely advettised, purporting to be of different
classes us strength, and at prices graduated accordingly;
the inventions of men who have no just claim to medical
knowledge or experience, much less of any knowledge
pertaining to Indian Arcana, or practice, and all such
impositions and scales of prices, are but so many devices
adopted to decieve and beguile the unwary and the cied
ulous, and lead to the sale and use of spurious if not ab
solutely injurious articles.
Dr. HILL is the only regulat physician whose advertise
merits have been before the public here and throughout
New England for the last twenty years, and who has al
ways made the In nan Medicines and systemof treatment
in all cases of Sex aa. Difficulties a large part of his theory
and practice during that period of time.
HIS FEMALE REGULATOR has but one formula
and strength, and is put up in bottles of convenient
size, hemietrically sealed, with accompanying directions
anu is forwarded to all partsol New England, the United
states, and the Canadas, in packages perfectly safe, bv
mail or express, on receipt of single price of $5 per but
tie. Communications by mall are Strictly Confidential,
and must contain his invariable fee of $J »o insure at
tention.
Btfar in mind! Hill's Female Regulator is a
preparation intended to meet and effectualh remedy and
cure all cases of Female dithcultj , confirmed or transient
and is the only preparation which will accomplish that
result, being the production as a physician widely
known throughout New England ana other sections of
the l mon, and whose success and testimonials far ex
cved those of any other practitioner of his age, in all
uranches of Private Practice, to be found in the coun
try. preparations are warranted Genuine un
less purchased at the oilice of DR. BILL. No. 82 Main
street, Worcester.

times be found safe, prompt and efficient in eradicating
disease, either acute or chronic and curing all cases.
A WORDS TO YOUNG MEN.-During the
practice ot fifteen years. Dr. Ilill has come in contact
with almost innumerable cases cf debility, occasiom d
by a dreadful habit us solitary self abuse. He contin
ues to wain all young men who are not affiicted to avoid
it as they value their lives, and to adc ise ad that are
troubled with the LaLit or its consequences where they
van be cured of such trouble, and to le them know the
dire disasters resulting in the non-attendance of them in
time. It is no exaggeration to say that three fourths of
the insane owe their malady to this honid habit. The
proprietors of Insane Asylumscorruboratc the statement,
and if the victim escapes ins nity or idiocy, yet lie or
she is entirely unfitted lor the real pleasures of file, either
in or out of the domestic circle—with procreative powers
ruined, afflicted with distrust, ever doubtful of his
friends—in tact, a perfect hypochondriac- what is be fit
for but to be cast out and die? Attend to them at once,
all you who have been addicted to this miserable habit,
or it may be too late, and you may go down to a dishorn
ored grave, hardly fit to meet the God who gave vmi .
powers which you have n ade a cur<e instead of a bless
ing, as they were intended. 7 here exists not in the
w hole world an object more loathsome, and miserable
than one thus broken in health and hopes. Avoid it, then,
as you wish fur happiness and heaven.
Dr. Hill’s practice is wholly on the botanic principle,
and iheretore upon a natuial foundation.

a FEW WORDS TO YOUNG MEN.—During the prac
tice of fifteen years. Dr. Hili has come in contact with
almost innuineiable eases of Debility, occasioned b
a dreadful habit of solitary seif abuse. They continue
to w arn all voting men who are not afflicted to avoid
Has they value their lives, ami to advise all whoaio
troubled with the habit or its consequences where
they van be cured of such trouble, ami to let them know
the <lire disasters resulting in the non attendance of them
nitinic. it is no exaggeration to say that three fourths
«»/ the insane owe their malady to this horrid habit. The
proprietors of Insane Asylums corroborate the state
ment, and if the victim escapes insanity or idocy, x ct he
or she is entirely unfitted tor the real’ pleasures 61 life,

powers ruined, afflicted with distrust, ever doubtful of
his triends, in fact, a perfect hypochondriac, what is he
fit tor but tobecastout and die. Attend to them at once,
all you who are ad lictcd to this miserable habit, of it
may be too late, and you may go down to a dishonored
grave, hardly fit to meet the Gud who gave you the pow
ets which you have made a curse instead of a blessing,
as they were intended. There exists not in the whole
world an object more loathsome or miserable than one
thus broken in health and hopes. Avoid it then as you
wish tor happiness ami heaven.
Dr. Bill’s practice is wholly on the. botanic principle,
and therefore upon a natural foundation.

A CUR E WAIiRA NTE D.
DR. HILL’S MIXTURE is warranted to cure emissions
and all diseases ot the Urinary Organs. Within the lust
tnree y.ars upwards of 306(1 bottles have been sold in
Boston, i d not a single case can be product d w here it
has failed to make a quirk ami lasting clue. This is not
a ii-cre assertion, but a well known fact, w hich can be
proved at any moment. Dr. Hili would not take this
method to make known the virtues of this never (ailing
Mixture, were it not to put the public on their guard
against the humbug preparations which are advertised
by certain apothecaries who know nothing of the dis
eases which they pretend to cure, who, for the sake of
making a few dollars, endanger the life, health, and con
stitution Of their di lud< d victims. To ail w lio are afflicted
with private complaints, but more especially to you who
have been duped by miserable pit tenders. Dr. Ilill would
earnestly recommend a trial us his nev or failing Mixture.
It never fails to cure the worst cases in a short time,
without regard to diet or ri-k of exposure. It is mild,
pleasant, and sate to take. It purifies the bloou, destroy s
the poison lurking in the system, ami completely reno
vates and renews the constitution. Dr. Hill’s Mixture,
if taken in season, will prevent as well as cure the cum
plaints for which it is recommended; in short, it is the
only sure ami safe remedy which has ever been discover
ed for the cure of all private complaints. Tho price of
Di- Hill’s Mixture is only 85 a bottle, and it will he sent
securely packed ami cone- a led to any part of the citv or
country when ordered, with the price, enclosed. Leiteis
(post-paid) directed to Dr. liil will receive prompt at
tention All consultations are held in private, w ithout
fear of exposure.
A CASE GENERAL DEBILITY.
MIRACULOUS CURE. About seven years ago, 1
continued a very heavy cold, which clung tome, with
dreadtui lenucity, resisting all the skill of physicians,
and the powe rof mediemes. I suffered constantly from
pain in the. heart; no*appetke; part of the time too
weak to walk; night sweats, which reeiuced me to a
shadow; agonizing pain in every joint in my body; cen
stantly chlllv; in a word, I was a poor, miserable, un
happy wretch, and often prayed for death. 1 emnloved
six or eight physicians, and must have taken at least a
hogshead < f nauseous n edicincs, ot one kind and anoth
er, but to no good purpose!, as 1 grew worse every day.
Finally, I went to Dr. Hill, who succeeded in curing me,
by his new and delightful system of treating diseases, [in
which tho patient is not requlreel to take nastv nicdi
cines.C 1 was thoroughly cured in about three months,
and mu now as well ami hearty as a buck. I advise the
sick to go to Dr. Bill, who will efiect a speedy cure at
one-half the price charged by other phvslelan’f, amino
filthy medicines, ""to bo well shaken before taken ""

pains in my head, lames, ami stomach, and a g( neral
feeling of soreness over my whole bodv. together with
shaking mid trembling and fearful dreams, which not
only unfitted me for the duties of life, but made life itself
a biirden. I tried dozens of remedies without success
and finally applied to Dr. Ilill, No. 82 Main street, and in
