footnote 6,Julian (Orat. i. p. 6.) affirms that Claudius acquired the empire in a juſt and even holy manner. But we may diſtruſt the partiality of a kinſman.

footnote 8,Aurelius Victor in Gallien. The people loudly prayed for the damnation of Gallienus. The ſenate decreed that his relations and ſervants ſhould be thrown down headlong from the Gemonian ſtairs. An obnoxious officer of the revenue had his eyes torn out whilſt under examination.
footnote 9,"Zonaras, l. xii. p. 137."

To confirm our idea, we may obſerve, that for a long time Mount Caelius was a grove of oaks, and Mount Viminal was over-run with oſiers; that, in the fourth century, the Aventine was a vacant and ſolitary eetirement; that, till the time of Auguſtus, the Eſquiline was an unwholeſome buryingground; and that the numerous inequalities, remarked by the ancients in the Quirinal, ſufficiently prove that it was not covered with buildings.

footnote 336,"Theſe ſchemes, however, reſt only on the very doubtful authority of Lactantius, de M. P. c. 20."
footnote 337,"This tradition, unknown to the contemporaries of Conſtantine, was invented in the darkneſs of monaſteries, was embelliſhed by Jeffrey of Monmouth, and the writers of the xiith century, has been defended by our antiquarians of the laſt age, and is ſeriouſly related in the ponderous hiſtory of England, compiled by Mr. Carte (vol. i. p. 147.). He tranſports, however, the kingdom of Coil, the imaginary father of Helena, from Eſſex to the wall of Antoninus."
footnote 338,"Eutropius (x. 2.) expreſſes, in a few words, the real truth, and the occaſion of the error, ""ex obſcuriori matrimonio ejus filius."" Zoſimus (l. ii. p. 78.) eagerly ſeized the moſt unfavourable report, and is followed by Oroſius (vii. 25.), whoſe authority is oddly enough overlooked by the indefatigable but partial Tillemont. By inſiſting on the divorce of Helena, Diocletian acknowledged her marriage."
footnote 339,"There are three opinions with regard to the place of Conſtantine's birth. 1. Our Engliſh antiquarians were uſed to dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyriſt;Britannias illic oriendo nobiles feciſti.But this celebrated paſſage may be referred with as much propriety to the acceſſion as to the nativity of Conſtantine. 2. Some of the modern Greeks have aſcribed the honour of his birth to Drepanum, a town on the gulph of Nicomedia (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 174.), which Conſtantine dignified with the name of Helenopolis, and Juſtinian adorned with many ſplendid buildings (Procop. de Aedificiis, v. 2.). It is indeed probable enough, that Helena's father kept an inn at Drepanum; and that Conſtantius might lodge there when he returned from a Perſian embaſſy in the reign of Aurelian. But in the wandering life of a ſoldier, the place of his marriage, and the places where his children are born, have very little connection with each other. 3. The claim of Naiſſus is ſupported by the anonymous writer, publiſhed at the end of Ammianus, p. 710, and who in general copied very good materials; and it is confirmed by Julius Firmicius (de Aſtrologiâ, l. i. c. 4.), who flouriſhed under the reign of Conſtantine himſelf. Some objections have been raiſed againſt the integrity of the text, and the application of the paſſage of Firmicius; but the former is eſtabliſhed by the beſt MSS. and the latter is very ably defended by Lipſius de Magnitudine Romana, l. iv. c. 11. et Supplement."

Such a bloody execution, without preventing a purſuit, would have ſcattered ſuſpicions, and might have ſtopped his journey."
footnote 343,"Anonym. p. 710. Panegyr. Veter. vii. 4. But Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 79. Euſebius de Vit. Conſtant. l. i. c. 21. and Lactantius de M. P. c. 24. ſuppoſe, with leſs accuracy, that he found his father on his death-bed."

They jointly dedicate, for the uſe oftheir ownRomans, this magnificent edifice. The architects have delineated the ruins of theſeThermae;and the antiquarians, particularly Donatus and Nardini, have aſcertained the ground which they covered.

M. de Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. iv. part i. p. 576.) very ſeriouſly examines whether, in contradiction to common ſenſe, the teſtimony of Euſebius and Zoſimus ought to prevail over the ſilence of Lactantius, Nazarius, and the anonymous, but contemporary orator, who compoſed the ninth panegyric."

footnote 416,"The ſituation of Aemona, or, as it is now called, Laybach, in Carniola (d'Anville Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 187.), may ſuggeſt a conjecture.

footnote 485,"The ancient practice of concluding the entertainment with libations, may be found in every claſſic. Socrates and Seneca, in their laſt moments, made a noble application of this cuſtom.

footnote 492,"Tertullian has compoſed a defence, or rather panegyric, of the raſh action of a Chriſtian ſoldier, who, by throwing away his crown of laurel, had expoſed himſelf and his brethren to the moſt imminent danger. By the mention of theemperors(Severus and Caracalla) it is evident, notwithſtanding the wiſhes of M. de Tillemont, that Tertullian compoſed his treatiſe De Coronâ, long before he was engaged in the errors of the Montaniſts. See Memoires Eccleſiaſtiques, tom. iii. p. 384."
footnote 493,"In particular, the firſt book of the Tuſculan Queſtions, and the treatiſe De Senectute, and the Somnium Scipionis, contain, in the moſt beautiful language, every thing that Grecian philoſophy, or Roman good ſenſe, could poſſibly ſuggeſt on this dark but important object."

footnote 496,"The xith book of the Odyſſey gives a very dreary and incoherent account of the infernal ſhades.

Vetus ille mos Gallorum occurrit (ſays Valerius Maximus, l. ii. c. 6. p. 10.), quos memoria proditur eſt, pecunias mutuas, quae his apud inferos redderentur, dare ſolitos. The ſame cuſtom is more darkly inſinuated by Mela, l. iii. c. 2. It is almoſt needleſs to add, that the profits of trade hold a juſt proportion to the credit of the merchant, and that the Druids derived from their holy profeſſion a character of reſponſibility, which could ſcarcely be claimed by any other order of men."

According to the moſt natural interpretation of his words, the Sadducees admitted only the Pentateuch; but it has pleaſed ſome modern critics to add the prophets to their creed, and to ſuppoſe, that they contented themſelves with rejecting the traditions of the Phariſees. Dr. Jortin has argued that point in his Remarks on Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, vol. ii. p. 103."
footnote 502,"This expectation was countenanced by the twenty-fourth chapter of St. Matthew, and by the firſt epiſtle of St. Paul to the Theſſalonians. Eraſmus removes the difficulty by the help of allegory and metaphor; and the learned Grotius ventures to inſinuate, that, for wiſe purpoſes, the pious deception was permitted to take place."
footnote 503,"See Burnet's Sacred Theory, part iii. c. 5. This tradition may be traced as high as the author of the Epiſtle of Barnabas, who wrote in the firſt century, and who ſeems to have been half a Jew."
footnote 504,"The primitive church of Antioch computed almoſt 6000 years from the creation of the world to the birth of Chriſt. Africanus, Lactantius, and the Greek church, have reduced that number to 5500, and Euſebius has contented himſelf with 5200 years. Theſe calculations were formed on the Septuagint, which was univerſally received during the ſix firſt centuries. The authority of the Vulgate and of the Hebrew text has determined the moderns, Proteſtants as well as Catholics, to prefer a period of about 4000 years; though, in the ſtudy of profane antiquity, they often find themſelves ſtreightened by thoſe narrow limits."
footnote 505,"Moſt of theſe pictures were borrowed from a miſinterpretation of Iſaiah, Daniel, and the Apocalypſe. One of the groſſeſt images may be found in Irenaeus (l. v. p. 455.), the diſciple of Papias, who had ſeen the apoſtle St. John."
footnote 506,"See the ſecond dialogue of Juſtin with Tryphon, and the ſeventh book of Lactantius. It is unneceſſary to allege all the intermediate fathers, as the fact is not diſputed. Yet the curious reader may conſult Daillè de Uſu Patrum, l. ii. c. 4."
footnote 507,"The teſtimony of Juſtin, of his own faith and that of his orthodox brethren, in the doctrine of a Millennium, is delivered in the cleareſt and moſt ſolemn manner (Dialog. cum Tryphonte Jud. p. 177, 178. Edit. Benedictin.). If in the beginning of this important paſſage there is any thing like an inconſiſtency, we may impute it, as we think proper, either to the author or to his tranſcribers."

footnote 509,"In the council of Laodicea (about the year 360) the Apocalypſe was tacitly excluded from the ſacred canon, by the ſame churches of Aſia to which it is addreſſed; and we may learn from the complaint of Sulpicius Severus, that their ſentence had been ratified by the greater number of Chriſtians of his time. From what cauſes then is the Apocalypſe at preſent ſo generally received by the Greek, the Roman, and the Proteſtant churches? The following ones may be aſſigned. 1. The Greeks were ſubdued by the authority of an impoſtor, who, in the ſixth century, aſſumed the character of Dionyſius the Areopagite. 2. A juſt apprehenſion, that the grammarians might become more important than the theologians, engaged the council of Trent to fix the ſeal of their infallibility on all the books of Scripture, contained in the Latin Vulgate, in the number of which the Apocalypſe was fortunately included. (Fra Paolo, Iſtoria del Concilio Tridentino, l. ii.) 3. The advantage of turning thoſe myſterious prophecies againſt the See of Rome, inſpired the proteſtants with uncommon veneration for ſo uſeful an ally. See the ingenious and elegant diſcourſes of the preſent biſhop of Litchfield on that unpromiſing ſubject."
footnote 510,"Lactantius (Inſtitut. Divin. vii. 15, &c.) relates the diſmal tale of futurity with great ſpirit and eloquence."
footnote 511,"On this ſubject every reader of taſte will be entertained with the third part of Burnet's Sacred Theory. He blends philoſophy, ſcripture, and tradition, into one magnificent ſyſtem; in the deſcription of which, he diſplays a ſtrength of fancy not inferior to that of Milton himſelf."
footnote 512,"And yet whatever may be the language of individuals, it is ſtill the public doctrine of all the Chriſtian churches; nor can even our own refuſe to admit the concluſions which muſt be drawn from the viiith and the xviiith of her Articles. The Janſeniſts, who have ſo diligently ſtudied the works of the fathers, maintain this ſentiment with diſtinguiſhed zeal, and the learned M. de Tillemont never diſmiſſes a virtuous emperor without pronouncing his damnation. Zuinglius is perhaps the only leader of a party who has ever adopted the milder ſentiment, and he gave no leſs offence to the Lutherans than to the Catholics. See Boſſuet, Hiſtoire des Variations des Egliſes Proteſtantes, l. ii. c. 19—22."
footnote 513,"Juſtin and Clemens of Alexandria allow that ſome of the philoſophers were inſtructed by the Logos; confounding its double ſignification, of the human reaſon, and of the Divine Word."
footnote 514,"Tertullian, De Spectaculis, c. 30. In order to aſcertain the degree of authority which the zealous African had acquired, it may be ſufficient to allege the teſtimony of Cyprian, the doctor and guide of all the weſtern churches. (See Prudent. Hymn. xiii. 100.) As often as he applied himſelf to his daily ſtudy of the writings of Tertullian, he was accuſtomed to ſay, ""Da mihi magiſtrum;Give me my maſter.""

footnote 673,"This teſtimony is alone ſufficient to expoſe the anachroniſm of the Jews, who place the birth of Chriſt near a century ſooner (Baſnage, Hiſtoire des Juifs, l. v. c. 14, 15.). We may learn from Joſephus (Antiquitat. xviii. 3.), that the procuratorſhip of Pilate correſponded with the laſt ten years of Tiberius, A. D. 27—37. As to the particular time of the death of Chriſt, a very early tradition fixed it to the 25th of March, A. D. 29, under the conſulſhip of the two Gemini (Tertullian adv. Judaeos, c. 8.). This date, which is adopted by Pagi, cardinal Norris, and Le Clerc, ſeems, at leaſt, as probable as the vulgar aera, which is placed (I know not from what conjectures) four years later."

Notwithſtanding the authority of Euſebius, and the ſilence of Lactantius, Ambroſe, Sulpicius, Oroſius, &c. it has been long believed, that the Thebaean legion, conſiſting of 6000 Chriſtians, ſuffered martyrdom, by the order of Maximian, in the valley of the Penine Alps. The ſtory was firſt publiſhed about the middle of the vth century, by Eucherius, biſhop of Lyons, who received it from certain perſons, who received it from Iſaac biſhop of Geneva, who is ſaid to have received it from Theodore biſhop of Octodurum. The Abbey of St. Maurice ſtill ſubſiſts, a rich monument of the credulity of Sigiſmond, king of Burgundy. See an excellent Diſſertation in the xxxvith volume of the Bibliothéque Raiſonnée, p. 427-454."

footnote 789,"De M. P. c. 11. Lactantius (or whoever was the author of this little treatiſe) was, at that time, an inhabitant of Nicomedia; but it ſeems difficult to conceive how he could acquire ſo accurate a knowledge of what paſſed in the Imperial cabinet."
footnote 790,"The only circumſtance which we can diſcover, is the devotion and jealouſy of the mother of Galerius. She is deſcribed by Lactantius, as Deorum montium cultrix; mulier admodum ſuperſtitioſa. She had a great influence over her ſon, and was offended by the diſregard of ſome of her Chriſtian ſervants."
footnote 791,"The worſhip and feſtival of the God Terminus are elegantly illuſtrated by M. de Boze, Mem. de l'Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. i. p. 50."
footnote 792,"In our only MS. of Lactantius, we readprofectus;but reaſon, and the authority of all the critics, allow us, inſtead of that word, which deſtroys the ſenſe of the paſſage, to ſubſtitutepraefectus."
footnote 793,"Lactantius de M. P. c. 12, gives a very lively picture of the deſtruction of the church."
footnote 794,"Moſheim (p. 922—926.), from many ſcattered paſſages of Lactantius and Euſebius, has collected a very juſt and accurate notion of this edict; though he ſometimes deviates into conjecture and refinement."
footnote 795,"Many ages afterwards, Edward I. practiſed, with great ſucceſs, the ſame mode of perſecution againſt the clergy of England. See Hume's Hiſtory of England, vol. ii. p. 300, laſt 4 to edition."
footnote 796,"Lactantius only calls him quidam, etſi non recte, magno tamen animo, &c. c. 12. Euſebius (l. viii. c. 5.) adorns him with ſecular honours. Neither have condeſcended to mention his name; but the Greeks celebrate his memory under that of John. See Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſtiques, tom. v. part ii. p. 320."
footnote 797,"Lactantius de M. P. c. 13, 14. Potentiſſimi quondam Eunuchi necati, per quos Palatium et ipſe conſtabat. Euſebius (l. viii. c. 6.) mentions the cruel extortions of the eunuchs, Gorgonius and Dorotheus, and of Anthimius, biſhop of Nicomedia; and both thoſe writers deſcribe, in a vague but tragical manner, the horrid ſcenes which were acted even in the Imperial preſence."
footnote 798,"See Lactantius, Euſebius, and Conſtantine, ad Coetum Sanctorum, c. 25. Euſebius confeſſes his ignorance of the cauſe of the fire."

footnote 800,"See the Acta Sincera of Ruinart, p. 353; thoſe of Foelix of Thibara, or Tibiur, appear much leſs corrupted than in the other editions, which afford a lively ſpecimen of legendary licence."
footnote 801,"See the firſt book of Optatus of Milevis againſt the Donatiſts at Paris, 1700. Edit. Dupin. He lived under the reign of Valens."
footnote 802,"The ancient monuments, publiſhed at the end of Optatus, p. 261, &c. deſcribe, in a very circumſtantial manner, the proceedings of the governors in the deſtruction of churches. They made a minute inventory of the plate, &c. which they found in them. That of the church of Cirta, in Numidia, is ſtill extant. It conſiſted of two chalices of gold, and ſix of ſilver; ſix urns, one kettle, ſeven lamps, all likewiſe of ſilver; beſides a large quantity of braſs utenſils, and wearing apparel."
footnote 803,"Lactantius (Inſtitut. Divin. v. 11.) confines the calamity to theconventiculum,with its congregation. Euſebius (viii. 11.) extends it to a whole city, and introduces ſomething very like a regular ſiege. His ancient Latin tranſlator, Rufinus, adds the important circumſtance of the permiſſion given to the inhabitants of retiring from thence. As Phrygia reached to the confines of Iſauria, it is poſſible that the reſtleſs temper of thoſe independent Barbarians may have contributed to this misfortune."
footnote 804,"Euſebius, l. viii. c. 6. M. de Valois (with ſome probability) thinks that he has diſcovered the Syrian rebellion in an oration of Libanius; and that it was a raſh attempt of the tribune Eugenius, who with only five hundred men ſeized Antioch, and might perhaps allure the Chriſtians by the promiſe of religious toleration. From Euſebius (l. ix. c. 8.) as well as from Moſes of Chorene (Hiſt. Armen. l. ii. c. 77, &c.) it may be inferred, that Chriſtianity was already introduced into Armenia."
footnote 805,"See Moſheim, p. 938; the text of Euſebius very plainly ſhews, that the governors, whoſe powers were enlarged, not reſtrained, by the new laws, could puniſh with death the moſt obſtinate Chriſtians, as an example to their brethren."

footnote 807,"Euſebius, l. viii. c. 13. Lactantius de M. P. c. 15. Dodwell (Diſſertat. Cyprian. xi. 75.) repreſents them as inconſiſtent with each other. But the former evidently ſpeaks of Conſtantius in the ſtation of Caeſar, and the latter of the ſame prince in the rank of Auguſtus."
footnote 808,"Datianus is mentioned in Gruter's Inſcriptions, as having determined the limits between the territories of Pax Julia, and thoſe of Ebora, both cities in the ſouthern part of Luſitania. If we recollect the neighbourhood of thoſe places to Cape St. Vincent, we may ſuſpect that the celebrated deacon and martyr of that name has been inaccurately aſſigned by Prudentius, &c. to Saragoſſa, or Valentia. See the pompous hiſtory of his ſufferings, in the Memoires de Tillemont, tom. v. part ii. p. 58—85. Some critics are of opinion, that the department of Conſtantius, as Caeſar, did not include Spain, which ſtill continued under the immediate juriſdiction of Maximian."
footnote 809,"Euſebius, l. viii. c. 11. Gruter, Inſcript. p. 1171. No. 18. Rufinus has miſtaken the office of Adauctus, as well as the place of his martyrdom."
footnote 810,"Euſebius, l. viii. c. 14. But as Maxentius was vanquiſhed by Conſtantine, it ſuited the purpoſe of Lactantius to place his death among thoſe of the perſecutors."
footnote 811,"The epitaph of Marcellus is to be found in Gruter, Inſcript. p. 1172. No. 3. and it contains all that we know of his hiſtory. Marcellinus and Marcellus, whoſe names follow in the liſt of popes, are ſuppoſed by many critics to be different perſons; but the learned Abbé de Longuerre was convinced that they were one and the ſame.Veridicus rector lapſis quia crimina flerePraedixit miſeris, fuit omnibus hoſtis amarus.Hinc furor, hinc odium; ſequitur diſcordia, lites,Seditio, caedes; ſolvuntur foedera pacis.Crimen ob alterius, Chriſtum qui in pace negavitFinibus expulſus patriae eſt feritate Tyranni.Haec breviter Damaſus voluit comperta referre:Marcelli populus meritum cognoſcere poſſet.We may obſerve that Damaſus was made biſhop of Rome, A.

footnote 813,"The Acts of the Paſſion of St. Boniface, which abound in miracles and declamation, are publiſhed by Ruinart (p. 283-291.), both in Greek and Latin, from the authority of very ancient manuſcripts."
footnote 814,"During the four firſt centuries, there exiſt few traces of either biſhops or biſhoprics in the weſtern Illyricum. It has been thought probable that the primate of Milan extended his juriſdiction over Sirmium, the capital of that great province. See the Geographia Sacra of Charles de St. Paul, p. 68-76. with the obſervations of Lucas Holſtenius."
footnote 815,"The viiith book of Euſebius, as well as the ſupplement concerning the martyrs of Paleſtine, principally relate to the perſecution of Galerius and Maximin. The general lamentations with which Lactantius opens the vth book of his Divine Inſtitutions, allude to their cruelty."
footnote 816,"Euſebius (l. viii. c. 17.) has given us a Greek verſion, and Lactantius (de M. P. c. 34.), the Latin original, of this memorable edict. Neither of theſe writers ſeems to recollect how directly it contradicts whatever they have juſt affirmed of the remorſe and repentance of Galerius."
footnote 817,"Euſebius, l. ix. c. 1. He inſerts the epiſtle of the praefect."
footnote 818,"See Euſebius, l. viii. c. 14. l. ix. c. 2—8. Lactantius de M. P. c. 36. Theſe writers agree in repreſenting the arts of Maximin: but the former relates the execution of ſeveral martyrs, while the latter expreſsly affirms, occidi ſervos Dei vetuit."
footnote 819,"A few days before his death, he publiſhed a very ample edict of toleration, in which he imputes all the ſeverities which the Chriſtians ſuffered to the judges and governors, who had miſunderſtood his intentions. See the Edict in Euſebius, l. ix. c. 10."
footnote 820,"Such is thefairdeduction from two remarkable paſſages in Euſebius, l. viii. c. 2. and de Martyr. Paleſtin. c. 12. The prudence of the hiſtorian has expoſed his own character to cenſure and ſuſpicion. It was well known that he himſelf had been thrown into priſon; and it was ſuggeſted that he had purchaſed his deliverance by ſome diſhonourable compliance. The reproach was urged in his life-time, and even in his preſence, at the council of Tyre. See Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſtiques, tom. viii. part i. p. 67."
footnote 821,"The ancient, and perhaps authentic, account of the ſufferings of Tarachus, and his companions (Acta Sincera Ruinart, p. 419—448), is filled with ſtrong expreſſions of reſentment and contempt, which could not fail of irritating the magiſtrate. The behaviour of Aedeſius to Hierocles, praefect of Egypt, was ſtill more extraordinary,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. Euſeb. de Martyr. Paleſtin. c. 5."

footnote 823,"Auguſtin. Collat. Carthagin. Dei, iii. c. 13. ap. Tillemont, Memoires Eccleſiaſtiques, tom. v. part i. p. 46. The controverſy with the Donatiſts has reflected ſome, though perhaps a partial, light on the hiſtory of the African church."
footnote 824,"Euſebius de Martyr. Paleſtin. c. 13. He cloſes his narration, by aſſuring us, that theſe were the martyrdoms inflicted in Paleſtine, during thewholecourſe of the perſecution. The vth chapter of his viiith book, which relates to the province of Thebais in Egypt, may ſeem to contradict our moderate computation; but it will only lead us to admire the artful management of the hiſtorian. Chuſing for the ſcene of the moſt exquiſite cruelty, the moſt remote and ſequeſtered country of the Roman empire, he relates, that in Thebais, from ten to one hundred perſons had frequently ſuffered martyrdom in the ſame day. But when he proceeds to mention his own journey into Egypt, his language inſenſibly becomes more cautious and moderate. Inſtead of a large, but definite number, he ſpeaks of many Chriſtians (〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉); and moſt artfully ſelects two ambiguous words (〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, and〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉), which may ſignify either what he had ſeen, or what he had heard; either the expectation, or the execution, of the puniſhment. Having thus provided a ſecure evaſion, he commits the equivocal paſſage to his readers and tranſlators; juſtly conceiving that their piety would induce them to prefer the moſt favourable ſenſe. There was perhaps ſome malice in the remark of Theodorus Metochita, that all who, like Euſebius, had been converſant with the Egyptians, delighted in an obſcure and intricate ſtyle. (See Valeſius ad loc.)"
footnote 825,"When Paleſtine was divided into three, the praefecture of the Eaſt contained forty-eight provinces. As the ancient diſtinctions ofnations were long ſince aboliſhed, the Romans diſtributed the provinces, according to a general proportion of their extent and opulence."

footnote 828,"Fra-Paolo (Iſtoria del Concilio Tridentino, l. iii.) reduces the number of Belgic martyrs to 50,000. In learning and moderation, Fra-Paolo was not inferior to Grotius. The priority of time gives ſome advantage to the evidence of the former, which he loſes on the other hand by the diſtance of Venice from the Netherlands."
