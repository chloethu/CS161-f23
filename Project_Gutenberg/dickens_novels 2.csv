Dickens,Tale,"It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.  Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,  as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth  blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had  heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were  made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane  ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its  messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally  deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the  earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,  from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange  to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any  communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane  brood.",year lord thousand seven seventy spiritual revelation concede england favour period southcott recently attain twentieth bless birthday prophetic private life guards herald sublime appearance announce arrangement swallowing london westminster cock lane ghost lay round dozen year rap message spirit year past supernaturally deficient originality rap theirs mere message earthly order event lately come english crown people congress british subject america strange relate prove important human race communication receive chicken cock lane brood
Dickens,Tale,"France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her  sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down  hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her  Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane  achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue  torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not  kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks  which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty  yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and  Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,  already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into  boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in  it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses  of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were  sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with  rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which  the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of  the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work  unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about  with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion  that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.",france favour matter spiritual sister shield trident roll exceed smoothness hill make paper money spend guidance christian pastor entertain humane achievement sentence youth hand cut tongue tear pincer body burn alive kneel rain honour dirty procession monk pass view distance yard likely root wood france norway grow tree sufferer death mark woodman fate come sawn board certain movable framework sack knife terrible history likely rough outhouse tiller heavy land adjacent paris shelter weather day rude cart bespatter rustic mire snuff pig roost poultry farmer death set apart tumbril revolution woodman farmer work unceasingly work silently hear go muffled tread forasmuch entertain suspicion awake atheistical traitorous
Dickens,Tale,"In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to  justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and  highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;  families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing  their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman  in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and  challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of  “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the  mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and  then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the  failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;  that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand  and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the  illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London  gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law  fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;  thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at  Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search  for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the  musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences  much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy  and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing  up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on  Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the  hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of  Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,  and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of  sixpence.",england scarcely order protection justify national boasting dare burglary armed man highway robbery take place capital night family publicly caution town remove furniture upholsterer warehouse security highwayman dark city tradesman light recognise challenge fellow tradesman stop character captain gallantly shoot head ride away mail waylay seven robber guard shoot dead get shoot dead consequence failure ammunition mail rob peace magnificent potentate lord mayor london stand deliver turnham green highwayman despoil illustrious creature sight retinue prisoner london gaol fight battle turnkey majesty law fire blunderbuss load round shot ball thief snip diamond crosse neck noble lord court drawing room musketeer go giles search contraband good mob fire musketeer musketeer fire mob think occurrence common way midst hangman busy bad useless constant requisition string long row miscellaneous criminal hang housebreaker saturday take tuesday burn people hand newgate dozen burn pamphlet door westminster hall day take life atrocious murderer morrow wretched pilferer rob farmer boy sixpence
Dickens,Tale,"All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close  upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.  Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,  those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the  fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights  with a high hand.

Dickens,Tale,"  It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,  before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.  The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up  Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,  as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish  for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,  and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the  horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the  coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back  to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in  combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose  otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals  are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to  their duty.",dover road lay friday night late november person history business dover road lay dover mail lumber shooter hill walk hill mire mail rest passenger relish walk exercise circumstance hill harness mud mail heavy horse time come stop draw coach road mutinous intent take blackheath rein whip coachman guard combination read article war forbid purpose strongly favour argument brute animal endue reason team capitulate return duty
Dickens,Tale,"With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through  the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were  falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested  them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the  near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an  unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the  hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a  nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.",droop head tremulous tail mash way thick mud flounder stumble while fall piece large joint driver rest bring stand wary wo ho ho near leader violently shake head like unusually emphatic horse deny coach get hill leader rattle passenger start nervous passenger disturb mind
Dickens,Tale,"There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its  forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding  none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the  air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the  waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out  everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,  and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed  into it, as if they had made it all.",steaming mist hollow roam forlornness hill like evil spirit seek rest find clammy intensely cold mist slow way air ripple visibly follow overspread wave unwholesome sea dense shut light coach lamp working yard road reek labour horse steam
Dickens,Tale,"Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the  side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the  ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from  anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was  hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from  the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers  were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on  the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,  when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in  “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable  non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard  of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one  thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as  he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,  and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a  loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,  deposited on a substratum of cutlass.",passenger plod hill mail wrap cheekbone ear wear jack boot say see like hide wrapper eye mind eye body companion day traveller shy confidential short notice anybody road robber league robber posting house ale house produce somebody captain pay range landlord low stable non descript likeli thing card guard dover mail think friday night november thousand seven seventy lumber shooter hill stand particular perch mail beat foot keep eye hand arm chest load blunderbuss lie loaded horse pistol deposit substratum cutlass
Dickens,Tale,"The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected  the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they  all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but  the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have  taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the  journey.",dover mail usual genial position guard suspect passenger passenger suspect guard suspect everybody coachman sure horse cattle clear conscience take oath testaments fit journey

Dickens,Tale,"The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,  made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed  suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its  passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach  stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three  had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead  into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of  getting shot instantly as a highwayman.",emphatic horse cut short whip decide negative decided scramble horse follow suit dover mail struggle jack boot passenger squash stop coach stop keep close company hardihood propose walk little ahead mist darkness fair way get shoot instantly highwayman

Dickens,Tale,"The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring  of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet  indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to  the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the  passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the  quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding  the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.",stillness consequent cessation rumble labouring coach add stillness night quiet panting horse communicate tremulous motion coach state agitation heart passenger beat loud hear rate quiet pause audibly expressive people breath hold breath have pulse quicken expectation

For he was  furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown  and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut  himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,  and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in  five minutes.",coach lumber heavy wreath mist closing round begin descent guard soon replace blunderbuss arm chest have look rest content have look supplementary pistol wear belt look small chest beneath seat smith tool couple torch tinder box furnish completeness coach lamp blow storm occasionally happen shut inside flint steel spark straw light tolerable safety ease lucky minute

Dickens,Tale,"  A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is  constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A  solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every  one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every  room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating  heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of  its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the  awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I  turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time  to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable  water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses  of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the  book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read  but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an  eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood  in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,  my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable  consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that  individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end.

He had eyes that  assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with  no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they  were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too  far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like  a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and  throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees.

The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,  and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with  all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then  the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable  stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a  little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among  them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them  safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.",tellson bank run mail bank passenger arm draw leathern strap lie pound passenger drive corner coach get special jolt nod place half shut eye little coach window coach lamp dimly gleam bulky bundle opposite passenger bank great stroke business rattle harness chink money draft honour minute tellson foreign home connection pay thrice time strong room underground tellson valuable store secret know passenger little know open go great key feebly burn candle find safe strong sound see

Consequently, another  drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all  loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord  and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a  brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large  square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to  his breakfast.",concord bed chamber assign passenger mail passenger mail heavily wrap head foot room odd interest establishment royal george kind man see kind variety man come consequently drawer porter maid landlady loitering accident point road concord coffee room gentleman formally dress brown suit clothe pretty worn keep large square cuff large flap pocket pass way breakfast

He had a good leg, and was a little vain  of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a  fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He  wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his  head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which  looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.  His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,  was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring  beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A  face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the  quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost  their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and  reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his  cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.

Dickens,Tale,"When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on  the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away  from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine  ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling  wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was  destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and  brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong  a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be  dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little  fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by  night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide  made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,  sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable  that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.",lorry finish breakfast go stroll beach little narrow crooked town dover hide away beach run head chalk cliff like marine ostrich beach desert heap sea stone tumble wildly sea like like destruction thunder town thunder cliff bring coast madly air house strong piscatory flavour suppose sick fish go dip sick people go dip sea little fishing port quantity stroll night look seaward particularly time tide near flood small tradesman business unaccountably realise large fortune remarkable neighbourhood endure lamplighter

It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black  horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and  oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room  were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep  graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected  from them until they were dug out.",gentleman tellson leave glass air stolid desperation settle odd little flaxen wig ear follow waiter miss manette apartment large dark room furnish funereal manner black horsehair load heavy dark table oil oil tall candle table middle room gloomily reflect leaf bury deep grave black mahogany light speak expect dig

As  his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden  hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and  a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth  it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was  not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright  fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his  eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,  of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very  Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran  high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of  the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital  procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were  offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the  feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.",obscurity difficult penetrate lorry pick way wear turkey carpet suppose miss manette moment adjacent room have get past tall candle see stand receive table fire young lady seventeen riding cloak hold straw travelling hat ribbon hand eye rest short slight pretty figure quantity golden hair pair blue eye meet inquire look forehead singular capacity remember young smooth rifte knit expression perplexity wonder alarm merely bright fix attention include expression eye rest thing sudden vivid likeness pass child hold arm passage channel cold time hail drift heavily sea run high likeness pass away like breath surface gaunt pier glass frame hospital procession negro cupid headless cripple offer black basket dead sea fruit black divinity feminine gender formal bow miss manette

Dickens,Tale,"  A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The  accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled  out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just  outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.",large cask wine drop break street accident happen get cart cask tumble run hoop burst lie stone outside door wine shop shatter like walnut shell
Dickens,Tale,"All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their  idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular  stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have  thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,  had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own  jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,  made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help  women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all  run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in  the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with  handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’  mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;  others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and  there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new  directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed  pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted  fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the  wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up  along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,  if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous  presence.",people reach suspend business idleness run spot drink wine rough irregular stone street point way design think expressly lame living creature approach dam little pool surround jostling group crowd accord size man kneel scoop hand join sip try help woman bend shoulder sip wine run finger man woman dip puddle little mug mutilated earthenware handkerchief woman head squeeze dry infant mouth small mud embankment stem wine run direct looker high window dart cut little stream wine start away new direction devote sodden lee dye piece cask licking champ moister wine rot fragment eager relish drainage carry wine take mud get take scavenger street anybody acquaint believe miraculous presence
Dickens,Tale,"A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,  and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There  was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a  special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part  of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the  luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,  shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen  together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been  most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these  demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who  had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in  motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of  hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own  starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men  with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into  the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom  gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.",shrill sound laughter amuse voice voice man woman child resound street wine game last little roughness sport playfulness special companionship observable inclination join lead especially lucky light hearted frolicsome embrace drink health shake hand join hand dancing dozen wine go place abundant rake gridiron pattern finger demonstration cease suddenly break man leave saw stick firewood cut set motion woman leave door step little pot hot ashe try soften pain starve finger toe child return man bare arm matted lock cadaverous face emerge winter light cellar move away descend gloom gather scene appear natural sunshine
Dickens,Tale,"The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street  in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had  stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many  wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks  on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was  stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.  Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a  tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his  head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled  upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.",wine red wine stain ground narrow street suburb saint antoine paris spill stain hand face naked foot wooden shoe hand man saw wood leave red mark billet forehead woman nurse baby stain stain old rag wind head greedy stave cask acquire tigerish smear mouth tall joker besmirch head long squalid bag nightcap scrawl wall finger dip muddy wine lee blood

Dickens,Tale,"And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary  gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was  heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in  waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;  but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a  terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the  fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,  passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered  in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which  had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the  children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the  grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,  was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out  of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and  lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and  paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of  firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless  chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,  among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the  baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of  bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that  was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting  chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every  farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant  drops of oil.",cloud settle saint antoine momentary gleam drive sacred countenance darkness heavy cold dirt sickness ignorance want lord wait saintly presence noble great power especially sample people undergo terrible grind regrinde mill certainly fabulous mill ground old people young shiver corner pass doorway look window flutter vestige garment wind shake mill work mill grind young people old child ancient face grave voice grow face plough furrow age come afresh sigh hunger prevalent hunger push tall house wretched clothing hang pole line hunger patch straw rag wood paper hunger repeat fragment small modicum firewood man saw hunger stare smokeless chimney start filthy street offal refuse eat hunger inscription baker shelf write small loaf scanty stock bad bread sausage shop dead dog preparation offer sale hunger rattle dry bone roasting chestnut turned cylinder hunger shre atomic farthing porringer husky chip potato fry reluctant drop oil
Dickens,Tale,"Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding  street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets  diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags  and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them  that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some  wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and  slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor  compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted  into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or  inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)  were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman  painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of  meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,  croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were  gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a  flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives  and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the  gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,  with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but  broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down  the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy  rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across  the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and  pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,  and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly  manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and  the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.",abide place thing fit narrow winding street offence stench narrow wind street diverging people rag nightcap smell rag nightcap visible thing brooding look look ill hunted air people wild beast thought possibility turn bay depressed slinking eye fire want compress lip white suppress forehead knit likeness gallow rope muse enduring inflict trade sign shop grim illustration want butcher porkman paint lean scrag meat baker coarse meagre loaf people rudely picture drink wine shop croak scanty measure thin wine beer gloweringly confidential represent flourish condition save tool weapon cutler knife axis sharp bright smith hammer heavy gunmaker stock murderous crippling stone pavement little reservoir mud water footway break abruptly door kennel amend run middle street run heavy rain run eccentric fit house street wide interval clumsy lamp sling rope pulley night lamplighter let light hoist feeble grove dim wick swing sickly manner overhead sea sea ship crew peril tempest
Dickens,Tale,"For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region  should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so  long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling  up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their  condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over  France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of  song and feather, took no warning.",time come gaunt scarecrow region watch lamplighter idleness hunger long conceive idea improve method haul man rope pulley flare darkness condition time come wind blow france shake rag scarecrow vain bird fine song feather take warning

Dickens,Tale,"Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he  came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with  a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand  heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of  manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might  have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself  in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being  sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright  shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large  earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick  her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported  by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but  coughed just one grain of cough.

In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the  gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee  to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips.

Dickens,Tale,"Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded  parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile  indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation  within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,  the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general  staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides  flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and  hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted  the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their  intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost  insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt  and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to  his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.  Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made  at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left  uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed  to crawl in.

Dickens,Tale,"The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the  faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no  doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was  the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo  of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and  resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once  beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and  suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground.

His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his  feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very  long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and  thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet  dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really  otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.  His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body  to be withered and worn.

It was an old-fashioned place,  moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were  proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,  proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence  in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if  it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable.

Dickens,Tale,"Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection  of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with  a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps,  and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little  counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the  wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of  windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,  and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the  heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing  “the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,  where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its  hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal  twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden  drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when  they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they  were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among  the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good  polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms  made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their  parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family  papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great  dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year  one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you  by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released  from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads  exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of  Abyssinia or Ashantee.",come pass tellson triumphant perfection inconvenience burst open door idiotic obstinacy weak rattle throat fall tellson step come sense miserable little shop little counter old man cheque shake wind rustle examine signature dingy window shower bath mud fleet street dingy iron bar proper heavy shadow temple bar business necessitate see house specie condemned hold meditate misspent life house come hand pocket hardly blink dismal twilight money come go wormy old wooden drawer particle fly nose throat open shut bank note musty odour fast decompose rag plate stow away neighbouring cesspool evil communication corrupt good polish day deed get extemporise strong room kitchen scullery fret fat parchment banking house air light box family paper go stair barmecide room great dining table dinner year thousand seven eighty letter write old love little child newly release horror ogle window head expose temple bar insensate brutality ferocity worthy abyssinia ashantee
Dickens,Tale,"But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue  with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s.  Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s?  Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note  was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the  purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder  of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to  Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of  three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to  Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it  might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the  reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each  particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked  after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business,  its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid  low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately  disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the  ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.",time put death recipe vogue trade profession tellson death nature remedy thing legislation accordingly forger death utterer bad note death unlawful opener letter death purloiner shilling sixpence death holder horse tellson door death coiner bad shilling death sounder fourth note gamut crime death good way prevention worth remark fact exactly reverse clear world trouble particular case leave connect look tellson day like great place business contemporary take life head lay low range temple bar instead privately disposed probably exclude little light ground floor significant manner

He was never absent during business hours, unless  upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin  of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson’s,  in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always  tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted  this person to the post.

Dickens,Tale,"They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had  not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.  But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and  villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came  into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the  dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It  had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced  his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him.  For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,  from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on  a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a  half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.  So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It  was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted  a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for  the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and  softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in  blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically  leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed  under Heaven.

Dickens,Tale,  CHAPTER III.  A Disappointment,chapter iii disappointment
Dickens,Tale,"  Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before  them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which  claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the  public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or  even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the  prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and  repassing between France and England, on secret business of which  he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of  traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real  wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.  That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who  was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the  prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his  Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.  That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and  attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s  friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his  infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish  in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues  were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public  benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as  they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,  as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well  knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;  whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that  they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more  especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.  That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness  for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had  communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him  a holy determination to examine his master’s table-drawers and pockets,  and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to  hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,  in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s)  brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.  Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence  on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two  witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be  produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of  his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by  sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed  such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be  proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting; but that it was all the  same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as  showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof  would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged  in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the  very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.  That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they  were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must  positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether  they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their  pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying  their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion  of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that  there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon  pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off. That head  Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of  everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith  of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as  good as dead and gone.",attorney general inform jury prisoner young year old treasonable practice claim forfeit life correspondence public enemy correspondence day yesterday year year certain prisoner long habit pass repasse france england secret business honest account nature traitorous way thrive happily real wickedness guilt business remain undiscovered providence heart person fear reproach ferret nature prisoner scheme strike horror disclose majesty chief secretary state honourable privy council patriot produce position attitude sublime prisoner friend auspicious evil hour detect infamy resolve immolate traitor long cherish bosom sacred altar country statue decree britain ancient greece rome public benefactor shine citizen assuredly decreed probably virtue observe poet passage know jury word word tip tongue whereat jury countenance display guilty consciousness know passage manner contagious especially bright virtue know patriotism love country lofty example immaculate unimpeachable witness crown refer unworthily honour communicate prisoner servant engender holy determination examine master table drawer pocket secrete paper attorney general prepare hear disparagement attempt admirable servant general way prefer attorney general brother sister honour attorney general father mother call confidence jury come likewise evidence witness couple document discovering produce prisoner furnish list majesty force disposition preparation sea land leave doubt habitually convey information hostile power list prove prisoner handwriting well prosecution show prisoner artful precaution proof year prisoner engage pernicious mission week date action fight british troop americans reason jury loyal jury know responsible jury know positively find prisoner guilty end like lay head pillow tolerate idea wife lay head pillow endure notion child lay head pillow short theirs laying head pillow prisoner head take head attorney general conclude demand think round turn faith solemn asseveration consider prisoner good dead go

Dickens,Tale,"The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a  great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and  simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais  packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.  He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of  charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of  the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging  his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the  prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from  the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there first. He  had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen  at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and  Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given  information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;  he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be  only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;  that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious  coincidence; most coincidences were curious.

How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this  attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies  and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;  how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous  character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the  State Trials of this country were full.

Dickens,Tale,"  Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his  fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in  his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to  the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur  was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many  things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather  rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so  much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four  strong men besides the Cook.",monseigneur great lord power court hold fortnightly reception grand hotel paris monseigneur inner room sanctuary sanctuary holiest holiests crowd worshipper suite room monseigneur chocolate monseigneur swallow great thing ease sullen mind suppose rapidly swallow france morning chocolate throat monseigneur aid strong man cook
Dickens,Tale,"Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the  Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his  pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to  conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One lacquey carried  the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed  the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;  a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold  watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to  dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high  place under the admiring Heavens.

Dickens,Tale,"Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy  and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at  a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so  impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far  more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and  state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance  for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly  favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted  days of the merry Stuart who sold it.",monseigneur little supper night comedy grand opera charmingly represent monseigneur little supper night fascinating company polite impressible monseigneur comedy grand opera far influence tiresome article state affair state secret need france happy circumstance france like country similarly england way example regret day merry stuart sell
Dickens,Tale,"Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which  was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public  business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go  his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and  particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world  was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original  by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness  thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”",monseigneur truly noble idea general public business let way particular public business monseigneur truly noble idea way tend power pocket pleasure general particular monseigneur truly noble idea world text order alter original pronoun run earth fulness thereof saith monseigneur
Dickens,Tale,"Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into  his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of  affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances  public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and  must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances  private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after  generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence  Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet  time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could  wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,  poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with  a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer  rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior  mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked  down upon him with the loftiest contempt.",monseigneur slowly find vulgar embarrassment creep affair private public class affair ally perforce farmer general finance public monseigneur consequently let somebody finance private farmer generals rich monseigneur generation great luxury expense grow poor monseigneur take sister convent time ward impending veil cheap garment wear bestow prize rich farmer general poor family farmer general carry appropriate cane golden apple company outer room prostrate mankind except superior mankind blood monseigneur wife include look lofty contempt
Dickens,Tale,"A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his  stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women  waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and  forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial  relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality  among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.",sumptuous man farmer general thirty horse stand stable male domestic sit hall body woman wait wife pretend plund forage farmer general howsoever matrimonial relation conduce social morality great reality personage attend hotel monseigneur day
Dickens,Tale,"For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with  every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could  achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any  reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not  so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost  equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would  have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have  been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers  destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;  civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the  worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;  all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in  pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of  Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which  anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the  score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,  yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives  passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were  no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies  for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly  patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had  discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the  State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to  root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears  they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving  Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making  card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving  Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this  wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of  the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been  since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural  subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of  exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various  notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies  among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half  of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among  the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and  appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of  bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far  towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing  known to the fashion.

Dickens,Tale,"The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance  upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional  people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that  things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting  them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic  sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves  whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the  spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the  Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other  three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a  jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the  Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got  out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of  the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,  by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much  discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never  became manifest.",leprosy unreality disfigure human creature attendance monseigneur outermost room half dozen exceptional people year vague misgive thing general go wrong promising way set right half half dozen member fantastic sect convulsionists consider foam rage roar turn cataleptic spot set highly intelligible finger post future monseigneur guidance dervishes rush sect mend matter jargon centre truth hold man get centre truth need demonstration get circumference keep fly circumference shove centre fast see spirit accordingly discourse spirit go world good manifest
Dickens,Tale,"But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of  Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been  ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally  correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such  delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant  swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would  surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen  of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they  languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;  and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and  fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and  his devouring hunger far away.",comfort company grand hotel monseigneur perfectly dressed day judgment ascertain dress day everybody eternally correct frizzling powdering stick hair delicate complexion artificially preserve mend gallant sword look delicate honour sense smell surely go exquisite gentleman fine breeding wear little pendent trinket chink languidly move golden fetter ring like precious little bell ringing rustle silk brocade fine linen flutter air fan saint antoine devouring hunger far away
Dickens,Tale,"Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all  things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that  was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through  Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals  of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball  descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was  required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,  and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a  rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother  Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call  him, presided in this dainty dress.

Dickens,Tale,"He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and  with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every  feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,  beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top  of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little  change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing  colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted  by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of  treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with  attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the  line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much  too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a  handsome face, and a remarkable one.",man handsomely dress haughty manner face like fine mask face transparent paleness feature clearly define set expression nose beautifully form slightly pinch nostril compression dint little change face show reside persist change colour occasionally dilate contract like faint pulsation give look treachery cruelty countenance examine attention capacity help look find line mouth line orbit eye horizontal thin effect face handsome face remarkable
Dickens,Tale,"Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and  drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had  stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer  in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable  to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and  often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were  charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no  check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had  sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,  that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician  custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a  barbarous manner.

Dickens,Tale,"  More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles  Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French  language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he  would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with  young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a  living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for  its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in  sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not  at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were  to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had  dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a  tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and  profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his  work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became  known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the  circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.

Yes, Sydney, I have had  enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I  feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels  inclined to go to it (when he doesn’t, he can stay away), and I feel  that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me  credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to  say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you  know; you really are in a bad way.

Argued with the jury on substantial worldly  grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a  plain case, and had not a weak spot in it.

The transition to the sport of  window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy  and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had  been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm  the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were  coming.

In the shadow of bank and  wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which  the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.  Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that  Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well  defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.  He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the  third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay  there a little--listening perhaps.

There was a  screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were  strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the  earth upon it, and came to the surface.

It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it  was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the  roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them  like a dropsical boy’s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways  too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up  to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,  and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was  incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy  got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then  it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every  stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on  his breast when he fell asleep.",stop necessary breath spectral sort race run highly desirable end strong idea coffin see run picture hop bolt upright narrow end point overtake hop take arm pursuer shun inconsistent ubiquitous fiend make night dreadful dart roadway avoid dark alley fearful come hopping like dropsical boy kite tail wing hide doorway rub horrible shoulder door draw ear laugh get shadow road lie cunningly trip time incessantly hop gain boy get door reason half dead leave follow upstairs bump stair scramble bed bump dead heavy breast fall asleep

A rumour just lived in the  village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that  when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to  faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled  up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel  look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the  stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder  was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which  everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the  scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the  crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a  skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all  started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares  who could find a living there.",madame defarge monsieur husband return amicably bosom saint antoine speck blue cap toil darkness dust weary mile avenue wayside slowly tend point compass chateau monsieur marquis grave listen whisper tree ample leisure stone face listen tree fountain village scarecrow quest herb eat fragment dead stick burn stray sight great stone courtyard terrace staircase bear starve fancy expression face alter rumour live village faint bare existence people knife strike home face change face pride face anger pain dangle figure haul foot fountain change bear cruel look avenge henceforth bear stone face great window bed chamber murder fine dint point sculptured nose everybody recognise see old scarce occasion ragged peasant emerge crowd hurried peep monsieur marquis petrify skinny finger point minute start away moss leave like fortunate hare find living

Dickens,Tale,"But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was  in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so  fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore  more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly  released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high  overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last  Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.  Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose  drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day.

Dickens,Tale,"  Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften  his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with  the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame  Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.

In both, there were several  knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense  of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on  the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how  hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;  but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to  destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work  before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.

As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern  without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian  aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a  mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many  highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled  with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.",time mender road work solitary dust trouble reflect dust dust return occupy think little supper eat time raise eye lonely labour view prospect rough figure approach foot like rarity part frequent presence advance mender road discern surprise shaggy haired man barbarian aspect tall wooden shoe clumsy eye mender road grim rough swart steep mud dust highway dank marshy moisture low ground sprinkle thorn leave moss byway wood

His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used  his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.  The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen  red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of  beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen  and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender  of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were  footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed  with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long  leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into  sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at  secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept  with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.  Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and  drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against  this figure.

The general scarcity of everything,  occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of  Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on  that functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to  authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,  and that post-horses would roast.",rider rattle hill street village illuminate mender road particular friend inspire man woman idea light dart house put candle dull little pane glass general scarcity occasion candle borrow peremptory manner monsieur gabelle moment reluctance hesitation functionary mender road submissive authority remark carriage good bonfire post horse roast
Dickens,Tale,"The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and  raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the  infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising  and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in  torment.

Molten  lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran  dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the  heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and  splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied  birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures  trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded  roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next  destination.

Whereupon,  Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel  with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again  withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time  resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man  of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the  parapet, and crush a man or two below.",village light head famine fire bell ringing bethink monsieur gabelle collection rent taxis small instalment taxis rent gabelle get day impatient interview surround house summon come forth personal conference monsieur gabelle heavily bar door retire hold counsel result conference gabelle withdraw housetop stack chimney time resolve door break small southern man retaliative temperament pitch head foremost parapet crush man

A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of  the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur  Gabelle had resolved!

Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most  to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson’s was a munificent  house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen  from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming  storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made  provident remittances to Tellson’s, were always to be heard of there  by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer  from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson’s, almost as  a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson’s was at that  time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this  was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in  consequence so numerous, that Tellson’s sometimes wrote the latest news  out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran  through Temple Bar to read.",natural head quarter great gathering place monseigneur london tellson bank spirit suppose haunt place body resorted monseigneur guinea haunt spot guinea spot french intelligence rely come quick tellson munificent house extend great liberality old customer fall high estate noble see come storm time anticipate plunder confiscation provident remittance tellson hear needy brother add new comer france report tiding tellson matter course variety reason tellson time french intelligence kind high exchange know public inquiry consequence numerous tellson write late news line post bank window run temple bar read

When the gaoler was  gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were  dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it  with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures  is the first condition of the body after death.”",cell chair table straw mattress gaoler general inspection object wall go wandering fancy wander mind prisoner lean wall opposite gaoler unwholesomely bloated face person look like man drown fill water gaoler go think wandering way leave dead stop look mattress turn sick feeling think crawl creature condition body death

The house belonged to  a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the  troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders.

For, all  things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce  precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month  of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of  Monseigneur’s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were  drinking brandy in its state apartments.",monseigneur go strong man absolve sin have draw high wage ready willing cut throat altar dawn republic indivisible liberty equality fraternity death monseigneur house sequestrate confiscate thing move fast decree follow decree fierce precipitation night autumn month september patriot emissary law possession monseigneur house mark tri colour drink brandy state apartment

For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have  said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid  over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson’s had whitewashed the  Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest  linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to  night.

It chanced that they  derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main  building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about  that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did  his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,  was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages  of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two  great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the  open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared  to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,  or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless  objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire.

False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their  hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with  howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of  sleep.

The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from  the smear of blood.

Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be  sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to  the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments  of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour.

That, in the prison he had  found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were  brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth  to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back  to their cells.

That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as  a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded  to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and  examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when  the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible  to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,  the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that  the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held  inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner  was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the  Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and  assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,  delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had  often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and  had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.",ascertain register table son law live prisoner plead hard tribunal member asleep awake dirty murder clean sober life liberty frantic greeting lavish notable sufferer overthrown system accord charles darnay bring lawless court examine point release tide favour meet unexplained check intelligible doctor lead word secret conference man sit president inform doctor manette prisoner remain custody sake hold inviolate safe custody immediately signal prisoner remove interior prison doctor strongly plead permission remain assure son law malice mischance deliver concourse murderous yell outside gate drown proceeding obtain permission remain hall blood danger

Being besought to go to him and dress  the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him  in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies  of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this  awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man  with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him  carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged  anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes  with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.",sight see brief snatch food sleep interval shall remain untold mad joy prisoner save astound scarcely mad ferocity cut piece prisoner say discharge street free mistaken savage thrust pike pass besought dress wound doctor pass gate find arm company samaritans seat body victim inconsistency monstrous awful nightmare help healer tend wounded man gentle solicitude litter escort carefully spot catch weapon plunge anew butchery dreadful doctor cover eye hand swoon away midst

As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be  helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid  of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw  the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing  of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a  clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which  had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.",see friend present aspect know present character time doctor feel suffering strength power time feel sharp fire slowly forge iron break prison door daughter husband deliver tend good end friend mere waste ruin beloved child helpful restore helpful restore dear aid heaven doctor manette jarvis lorry see kindled eye resolute face calm strong look bear man life stop like clock year set go energy lie dormant cessation usefulness believe

While he kept himself  in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees  of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his  personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician  of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie  that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the  general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet  messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself  sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she was  not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of  plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were  known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.",great thing doctor time contend yield persevere purpose keep place physician business degree mankind bond free rich poor bad good personal influence wisely soon inspect physician prison la force assure lucie husband long confine mixed general body prisoner see husband weekly bring sweet message straight lip husband send letter doctor hand permit write wild suspicion plot prison wildest point emigrant know friend permanent connection abroad

Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;  but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that  time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter  and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.  Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through  that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s  ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,  that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to  trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself  and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and  affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in  rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All  curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all  natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it  couldn’t be in better hands.”",new life doctor anxious life doubt sagacious lorry see new sustain pride unbecoming tinge pride natural worthy observe curiosity doctor know time imprisonment associate mind daughter friend personal affliction deprivation weakness change know invest old trial force look charles ultimate safety deliverance far exalt change take lead direction require weak trust strong precede relative position lucie reverse lively gratitude affection reverse pride render service render curious think lorry amiably shrewd way natural right lead dear friend well hand
Dickens,Tale,"But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get  Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,  the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new  era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of  Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death  against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the  great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise  against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils  of France, as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and  had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and  alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of  the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds  and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the  fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.

Yet the  current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time  away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three  months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more  wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,  that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the  violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares  under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the  terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at  that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable  in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and  victims, he was a man apart.

A moment  afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the  prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with  The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and  they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music  than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,  keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.  Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced  together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a  mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they  filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly  apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They  advanced, retreated, struck at one another’s hands, clutched at one  another’s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round  in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest  linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,  and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they  all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then  reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped  again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width  of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high  up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible  as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once  innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into  a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the  heart.

The prisoners were far from  insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the  time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour  or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to  brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere  boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind.

Looking  at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the  usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the  honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never  without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing  spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,  anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,  the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore  knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many  knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under  her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom  he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly  remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in  his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed  in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to  himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to  be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at  the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,  in his usual quiet dress.

No sooner  was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood  at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the  prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after  his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from  exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same  people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with  the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the  streets.",begin extraordinary scene populace gratify fickleness well impulse generosity mercy regard set swollen account cruel rage man decide motive extraordinary scene referable probable blending second predominating soon acquittal pronounce tear shed freely blood time fraternal embrace bestow prisoner sex rush long unwholesome confinement danger faint exhaustion know people carry current rush intensity rend piece strew street

He  knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint  Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police  such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s imprisonment,  release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to  familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame  Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered  with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he  talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.  He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over  again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the  guillotine then surely swallowed up.

Once denounced, and on such  grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw  that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many  proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash  his last chance of life.

Dickens,Tale,"There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully  disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded  than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a  strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great  determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart  to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an  instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have  heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood  with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,  opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without  pity.

It was nothing to her, that  his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was  insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and  her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made  hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had  been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which  she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had  been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any  softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who  sent her there.",innocent man die sin forefather see wife widow daughter orphan insufficient punishment natural enemy prey right live appeal hopeless have sense pity lay low street encounter engage pity order axe morrow go soft feeling fierce desire change place man send

Carelessly  worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her  dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her  bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened  dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such  a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually  walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown  sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.",heart madame defarge carry rough robe carelessly worn robe certain weird way dark hair look rich coarse red cap lie hide bosom loaded pistol lie hide waist sharpen dagger accoutre walk confident tread character supple freedom woman habitually walk girlhood bare foot bare legged brown sea sand madame defarge take way street
Dickens,Tale,"Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment  waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,  the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry’s  attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,  but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining  it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their  escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.  Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross  and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at  three o’clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.  Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,  passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in  advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours  of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.",journey travel coach moment wait completion load plan night difficulty take miss pross engage lorry attention merely desirable avoid overload coach high importance time occupy examine passenger reduce utmost escape depend saving second finally propose anxious consideration miss pross jerry liberty leave city leave light wheeled conveyance know period unencumbered luggage soon overtake coach pass precede road order horse advance greatly facilitate progress precious hour night delay dread

Dickens,Tale,"As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up  a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces  are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.  So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that  in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the  hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in  the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;  then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a  curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to  tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.",sombre wheel cart round plough long crook furrow populace street ridge face throw plough steadily onward regular inhabitant house spectacle window people occupation hand suspend eye survey face tumbril inmate visitor sight point finger complacency curator authorise exponent cart tell sit yesterday day
Dickens,Tale,"Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all  things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with  a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with  drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so  heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as  they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,  and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and  he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made  drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance.

Dickens,Tale,"There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,  and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some  question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is  always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The  horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with  their swords.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,  that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard  and fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and  sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she  took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,  in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—using  both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and  moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a  final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very  thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the  loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.",sister trenchant way cut bread butter vary left hand jam loaf hard fast get pin needle get mouth take butter knife spread loaf apothecary kind way make side knife slapping dexterity trim mould butter round crust give knife final smart wipe edge plaster saw thick round loaf finally separate loaf hew half joe get
Dickens,Great Expectations,"On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.  I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful  acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew  Mrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my  larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.  Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of  my trousers.",present occasion hungry dare eat slice feel reserve dreadful acquaintance ally dreadful young man know joe housekeeping strict kind larcenous research find available safe resolve hunk bread butter leg trouser
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I  found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap  from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.  And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our  already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his  good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare  the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each  other’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.  To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast  diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he  found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my  untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately  considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had  best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the  circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at  me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.",effort resolution necessary achievement purpose find awful mind leap high house plunge great depth water difficult unconscious joe mention freemasonry fellow sufferer good natured companionship evening habit compare way bite slice silently hold admiration stimulate new exertion night joe time invite display fast diminish slice enter usual friendly competition find time yellow mug tea knee untouched bread butter desperately consider thing contemplate good improbable manner consistent circumstance take advantage moment joe look get bread butter leg
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss  of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he  didn’t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than  usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like  a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on  one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw  that my bread and butter was gone.",joe evidently uncomfortable suppose loss appetite take thoughtful bite slice enjoy turn mouth long usual ponder good deal gulp like pill bite get head good purchase eye fall see bread butter go

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine  medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;  having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the  best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a  choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like  a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded  a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater  comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be  held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to  swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and  meditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging from  myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had  none before.",medical beast revive tar water day fine medicine joe keep supply cupboard have belief virtue correspondent nastiness good time elixir administer choice restorative conscious go smell like new fence particular evening urgency case demand pint mixture pour throat great comfort joe hold head arm boot hold bootjack joe get half pint swallow disturbance sit slowly munch meditate fire turn judge certainly turn
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in  the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret  burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great  punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I  never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the  housekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping  one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about  the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,  as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the  voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to  secrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve until  to-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the  young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his  hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should  mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and  liver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody’s hair stood on  end with terror, mine must have done so then.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with  a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with  the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the  load on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the  bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable.

No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in  mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in  mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal  terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had  no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me  at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on  requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.",time far away think people know secrecy young terror matter unreasonable terror terror mortal terror young man want heart liver mortal terror interlocutor iron leg mortal terror awful promise extract hope deliverance powerful sister repulse turn afraid think requirement secrecy terror
Dickens,Great Expectations,"If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting  down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate  calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the  gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at  once, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been  inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob  the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no  getting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have  struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very  pirate himself rattling his chains.",sleep night imagine drift river strong spring tide hulks ghostly pirate call speak trumpet pass gibbet station well come ashore hang afraid sleep incline know faint dawn morning rob pantry night get light easy friction get strike flint steel noise like pirate rattle chain
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was  shot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,  and every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Get  up, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied  than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare  hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back  was half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for  selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole  some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I  tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night’s slice), some  brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had  secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,  Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from  a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and  a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the  pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that  was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,  and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not  intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.",soon great black velvet pall outside little window shoot grey get go downstairs board way crack board call stop thief joe pantry far abundantly supply usual owe season alarm hare hang heel think catch half turn winking time verification time selection time time spare steal bread rind cheese half jar mincemeat tie pocket handkerchief night slice brandy stone bottle decant glass bottle secretly make intoxicate fluid spanish liquorice water room dilute stone bottle jug kitchen cupboard meat bone little beautiful round compact pork pie nearly go away pie tempt mount shelf look away carefully cover earthenware dish corner find pie take hope intend early use miss time
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I  unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s tools.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the  outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there  all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw  the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort  of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.  On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so  thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our  village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came  there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I  looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience  like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.",rimy morning damp see damp lie outside little window goblin cry night window pocket handkerchief see damp lie bare hedge spare grass like coarser sort spider webs hang twig twig blade blade rail gate wet lie clammy marsh mist thick wooden finger post direct people village direction accept come invisible close look drip oppressed conscience like phantom devote hulks
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that  instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.  This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and  banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly  as could be, “A boy with somebody else’s pork pie! Stop him!” The  cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,  and steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One black  ox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened conscience  something of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and  moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved  round, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir! It wasn’t  for myself I took it!” Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of  smoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and  a flourish of his tail.",mist heavy get marsh instead run run disagreeable guilty mind gate dike bank come burst mist cry plainly boy somebody pork pie stop cattle come like suddenness stare eye steam nostril halloa young thief black ox white cravat awakened conscience clerical obstinately eye move blunt head round accusatory manner move round blubber help sir take head blow cloud smoke nose vanish kick hind leg flourish tail
Dickens,Great Expectations,"All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I  went, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,  as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I  knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there  on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that  when I was ’prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks  there! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last  too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the  river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes  that staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I  had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and  had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man  sitting before me.

All this I saw in a moment, for  I had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at  me,—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself  down, for it made him stumble,—and then he ran into the mist, stumbling  twice as he went, and I lost him.",man dress coarse grey great iron leg lame hoarse cold man face flat broad brim low crown feel hat see moment moment swear oath hit round weak blow miss knock run mist stumble twice go lose

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right  man,—hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all  night left off hugging and limping,—waiting for me. He was awfully  cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face  and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that  when I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it  occurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my  bundle. He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had,  but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my  pockets.",soon battery right limp fro night leave hugging awfully cold sure half expect drop face die deadly cold eye look awfully hungry hand file lay grass occur try eat see bundle turn upside time leave right upwards open bundle empty pocket

He  swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;  and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought  there was danger in every direction of somebody’s coming to take the  pie away.

I was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself  into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping  away from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice,  so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off.

Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the  house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon  the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article into  which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was  vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.",fully expect find constable kitchen wait constable discovery robbery joe prodigiously busy get house ready festivity day joe kitchen doorstep dust article destiny lead soon later sister vigorously reap floor establishment

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had  retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a  conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her  eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and  exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.  This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for  weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to  their legs.",joe venture kitchen dustpan retire draw hand nose conciliatory air joe dart look eye withdraw secretly cross forefinger exhibit token joe cross temper normal state joe week finger like monumental crusaders leg
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork  and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had  been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not  being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive  arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of  breakfast; “for I ain’t,” said Mrs. Joe,—“I ain’t a-going to have no  formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I’ve got  before me, I promise you!”",superb dinner consist leg pickle pork green pair roast stuff fowl handsome mince pie yesterday morning account mincemeat miss pudding boil extensive arrangement occasion cut unceremoniously respect breakfast ai say ai going formal cramming bust wash get promise
Dickens,Great Expectations,"So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on  a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of  milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the  dresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and  tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the  old one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,  which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the  year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four  little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black  nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of  the other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite  art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than  dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the  same by their religion.",slice serve thousand troop force march instead man boy home take gulp milk water apologetic countenance jug dresser meantime joe clean white curtain tack new flower flounce wide chimney replace old uncover little state parlour passage uncover time pass rest year cool haze silver paper extend little white crockery poodle mantel shelf black nose basket flower mouth counterpart joe clean housekeeper exquisite art make cleanliness uncomfortable unacceptable dirt cleanliness godliness people religion
Dickens,Great Expectations,"My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that  is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a  well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he  was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.  Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and  everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive  occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,  the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,  I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young  offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and  delivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged  majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being  born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,  and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I  was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make  them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the  free use of my limbs.",sister have go church vicariously joe go working clothe joe knit characteristic look blacksmith holiday clothe like scarecrow good circumstance wear fit belong wear graze present festive occasion emerge room blithe bell go picture misery suit sunday penitential think sister general idea young offender accoucheur policeman take birthday deliver deal accord outraged majesty law treat insist bear opposition dictate reason religion morality dissuade argument good friend take new suit clothe tailor order like kind reformatory account let free use limb
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle  for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to  what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.  Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be  equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had  done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the  Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the  terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived  the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman  said, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise and  propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure  that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to  this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.",joe go church move spectacle compassionate mind suffer outside undergo terror assail joe go near pantry room equal remorse mind dwelt hand weight wicked secret ponder church powerful shield vengeance terrible young man divulge establishment conceive idea time bann read clergyman say ye declare time rise propose private conference vestry far sure astonish small congregation resort extreme measure christmas day sunday
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble  the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle,  but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in  the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was  half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and  Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked  (it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and  everything most splendid.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and  the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large  shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud  of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could  only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he  himself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning to  competition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church  not being “thrown open,” he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he  punished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—always  giving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, as  much as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your  opinion of this style!”",time come bring relief feeling company come wopsle unite roman nose large shine bald forehead deep voice uncommonly proud understand acquaintance head read clergyman fit confess church throw open mean competition despair make mark church throw open say clerk punish amens tremendously give give look round congregation hear friend overhead oblige opinion style

Dickens,Great Expectations,"We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts  and oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very like  Joe’s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister  was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally  more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I  remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,  who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married  Mr. Hubble,—I don’t know at what remote period,—when she was much  younger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,  stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs  extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some  miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.",dine occasion kitchen adjourn nut orange apple parlour change like joe change working clothe sunday dress sister uncommonly lively present occasion generally gracious society hubble company remember hubble little curly sharp edge person sky blue hold conventionally juvenile position marry know remote young remember mr hubble tough high shoulder stoop old man sawdusty fragrance leg extraordinarily wide apart short day see mile open country meet come lane
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn’t  robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in  at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and  the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to  speak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the  scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure  corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason  to be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have  left me alone. But they wouldn’t leave me alone. They seemed to think  the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,  every now and then, and stick the point into me.

Mr. Wopsle said grace with  theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a  religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and  ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.

After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, he  remarked that he considered the subject of the day’s homily, ill  chosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many  subjects “going about.”",little later dinner wopsle review sermon severity intimate usual hypothetical case church throw kind sermon give favour head discourse remark consider subject day homily ill choose excusable add subject go

Would he have been doing that? No, he  wouldn’t. And what would have been your destination?” turning on me  again. “You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according  to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would  have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped  you under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his  frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would  have shed your blood and had your life.

Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, during  the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it  until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in  comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the  pause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in which  pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with  indignation and abhorrence.",think romans aggravate nose restless people consequence wopsle roman nose aggravate recital misdemeanour like pull howl endure time comparison awful feeling take possession pause break ensue sister recital pause everybody look feel painfully conscious indignation abhorrence

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for  another glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality  appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the  bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a  gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine  that he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with  the same liberality, when the first was gone.",sergeant toss glass ready glass notice pumblechook hospitality appear forget present wine take bottle joe credit hand gush joviality get free wine call bottle hand liberality go
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,  enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a  dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed  themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened  with the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively  anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows  seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke  to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and  all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the  blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale  afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have  turned pale on their account, poor wretches.",watch stand cluster forge enjoy think terrible good sauce dinner fugitive friend marsh enjoy quarter entertainment brighten excitement furnish lively anticipation villain take bellow roar fugitive fire flare smoke hurry away pursuit joe hammer clink murky shadow wall shake menace blaze rise sink red hot spark drop die pale afternoon outside pity young fancy turn pale account poor wretch
Dickens,Great Expectations,"At last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As  Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us  should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.  Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies’  society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was  agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should  have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s curiosity to know  all about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, “If  you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don’t  look to me to put it together again.”",joe job ringing roaring stop joe get coat muster courage propose soldier come hunt pumblechook hubble decline plea pipe lady society wopsle say joe joe say agreeable joe approve get leave sure joe curiosity know end merely stipulate bring boy head blow bit musket look
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.  Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully  sensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as when  something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.  Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and  to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in  the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I  treasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find them.” and  Joe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut and run,  Pip.”",sergeant take polite leave lady part pumblechook comrade doubt fully sensible gentleman merit arid condition moist go man resume musket fall wopsle joe receive strict charge rear speak word reach marsh raw air steadily move business treasonably whisper joe hope joe sha find joe whisper shilling cut run pip
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was  cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming  on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A  few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came  out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.  There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant’s  hand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the  graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding  anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate  at the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us  here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.",join straggler village weather cold threatening way dreary footing bad darkness come people good fire door keep day face hurry glow window look come pass finger post hold straight churchyard stop minute signal sergeant hand man disperse grave examine porch come find strike open marsh gate churchyard bitter sleet come rattle east wind joe take
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little  thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men  hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should  come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who  had brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving  imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the  hunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in  treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?",dismal wilderness little think hour see man hiding consider time great dread come particular convict suppose bring soldier ask deceive imp say fierce young hound join hunt believe imp hound treacherous earnest betray
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe’s  back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a  hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and  to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a  pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking  the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.  Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.  Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the  mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,  though all of a watery lead colour.",use ask question joe joe beneath charge ditch like hunter stimulate wopsle tumble roman nose soldier extend pretty wide line interval man man take course begin diverge mist mist wind dispel low red glare sunset beacon gibbet mound battery opposite shore river plain watery lead colour
Dickens,Great Expectations,"With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder, I  looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I  could hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by  his blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and  could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful  start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a  sheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;  and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared  angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except  these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,  there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.",heart thump like blacksmith joe broad shoulder look sign convict hear wopsle greatly alarm blowing hard breathing know sound time dissociate object pursuit get dreadful start think hear file go sheep bell sheep stop eating look timidly cattle head turn wind sleet stare angrily hold responsible annoyance thing shudder die day blade grass break bleak stillness marsh
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we  were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all  stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a  long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but  it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised  together,—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.",soldier move direction old battery move little way sudden stop reach wing wind rain long shout repeat distance east long loud nay shout raise judge confusion sound
Dickens,Great Expectations,"To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under  their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment’s listening,  Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)  agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not  be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men  should make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right  (where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had  to hold on tight to keep my seat.",effect sergeant near man speak breath joe come moment listening joe good judge agree wopsle bad judge agree sergeant decisive man order sound answer course change man double slant right east joe pound away wonderfully hold tight seat
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he  spoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and over  gates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no  man cared where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became  more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.  Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.  When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate  than ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,  that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice,  “Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!” Then  both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would  break out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like  deer, and Joe too.",run joe call word speak time winder bank bank gate splash dike break coarse rush man care go come near shouting apparent voice stop altogether soldier stop break soldier great rate run hear voice call murder voice convict runaway guard way runaway convict voice stifle struggle break come soldier run like deer joe

At that point, my convict  became so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him  but for the interposition of the soldiers. “Didn’t I tell you,” said  the other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?” And any  one could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon  his lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.",work work dry lip turn eye restlessly far near turn moment speaker word look half taunt glance bind hand point convict frantically exasperate rush interposition soldier tell say convict murder shake fear break lip curious white flake like thin snow

Dickens,Great Expectations,"As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went  down on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first  time, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of the  ditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly  when he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I  had been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my  innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended  my intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it  all passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a  day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having  been more attentive.",soldier carry basket lieu gun go knee open convict look round time see alight joe brink ditch come move look eagerly look slightly move hand shake head wait try assure innocence express comprehend intention give look understand pass moment look hour day remember face have attentive
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four  torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been  almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards  very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in  a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches  kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the  opposite bank of the river. “All right,” said the sergeant. “March.”",soldier basket soon get light light torch take distribute dark dark soon dark depart spot soldier stand ring fire twice air presently see torch kindle distance marsh opposite bank river right say sergeant march
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a  sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. “You are expected  on board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming.  Don’t straggle, my man. Close up here.”",go far cannon fire ahead sound burst inside ear expect board say sergeant convict know come straggle man close
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate  guard. I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of the  torches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to  see it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good  path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and  there where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy  sluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming  in after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon  the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I  could see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air  about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather  to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We  could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,  that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.",keep apart walk surround separate guard hold joe hand joe carry torch wopsle go joe resolve go party reasonably good path edge river divergence dike come miniature windmill muddy sluice gate look round light come torch carry drop great blotch fire track lie smoking flaring black darkness light warm air pitchy blaze prisoner like limp midst musket fast lameness spent time halt rest
Dickens,Great Expectations,"After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut  and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,  and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was  a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a  stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an  overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a  dozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in  their great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their  heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant  made some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the  convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,  to go on board first.",hour travelling come rough wooden hut landing place guard hut challenge sergeant answer go hut smell tobacco whitewash bright fire lamp stand musket drum low wooden bedstead like overgrown mangle machinery capable hold dozen soldier soldier lie great coat interested lift head take sleepy stare lay sergeant kind report entry book convict convict draft guard board

While we stood in the  hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up  his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if  he pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the  sergeant, and remarked,—",convict look stand hut stand fire look thoughtfully put foot turn hob look thoughtfully pity recent adventure suddenly turn sergeant remark

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throat  again, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard  were ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough  stakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a  crew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or  interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or  spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,  “Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the  light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from  the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark. Cribbed and barred and  moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes  to be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we  saw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches  were flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over  with him.",notice click man throat turn boat return guard ready follow landing place rough stake stone see boat row crew convict like surprised interested see glad sorry speak word somebody boat growl dog way signal dip oar light torch see black hulk lie little way mud shore like wicked noah ark cribbed bar moor massive rusty chain prison ship young eye iron like prisoner see boat alongside see take disappear end torch fling hiss water go

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference  to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I  loved Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than  because the dear fellow let me love him,—and, as to him, my inner self  was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when  I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe  the whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted  that if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing  Joe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at  night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up  my tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I  never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair  whisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe  knew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at  yesterday’s meat or pudding when it came on to-day’s table, without  thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,  if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life  remarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he  suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,  I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too  cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no  intercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its  many inhabitants who act in this manner.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took  me on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome  journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad  temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have  excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In  his lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an  insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the  kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have  hanged him, if it had been a capital offence.",sleepy far away prison ship joe take carry home tiresome journey wopsle knock bad temper church throw open probably excommunicate expedition begin joe lay capacity persist sit damp insane extent coat take dry kitchen fire circumstantial evidence trouser hang capital offence
Dickens,Great Expectations,"By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little  drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through  having been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and  noise of tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump  between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah! Was there  ever such a boy as this!” from my sister,) I found Joe telling them  about the convict’s confession, and all the visitors suggesting  different ways by which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook  made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got  upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the  house, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made  of his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very  positive and drove his own chaise-cart—over everybody—it was agreed  that it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, “No!” with  the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat  on, he was unanimously set at naught,—not to mention his smoking hard  behind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp  out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.",time staggering kitchen floor like little drunkard have newly set foot have fast asleep wake heat light noise tongue come aid heavy thump shoulder restorative exclamation yah boy sister find joe tell convict confession visitor suggest different way get pantry pumblechook carefully survey premise get roof forge get roof house let kitchen chimney rope bedding cut strip pumblechook positive drive chaise cart everybody agree wopsle wildly cry feeble malice tired man theory coat unanimously set mention smoking hard stand kitchen fire draw damp calculate inspire confidence
Dickens,Great Expectations,"This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a  slumberous offence to the company’s eyesight, and assisted me up to bed  with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be  dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as  I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted  long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned  saving on exceptional occasions.",hear night sister clutch slumberous offence company eyesight assist bed strong hand boot dangle edge stair state mind describe begin morning last long subject die cease mention save exceptional occasion
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family  tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My  construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I  read “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’s  exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations  had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed  the worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my  notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at  all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my  declaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,”  laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our  house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down  by the wheelwright’s or up by the mill.",time stand churchyard read family tombstone learning able spell construction simple meaning correct read wife complimentary reference father exaltation well world deceased relation refer doubt form bad opinion member family notion theological position catechism bind accurate lively remembrance suppose declaration walk day life lay obligation village house particular direction vary turn wheelwright mill
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I  could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called  “Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only  odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extra  boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was  favoured with the employment.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is  to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited  infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in  the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the  improving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage,  and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to  overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and  occasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr.  Wopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those  occasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark  Antony’s oration over the body of Caesar. This was always followed by  Collins’s Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr.  Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and  taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not  with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of  the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the  disadvantage of both gentlemen.",wopsle great aunt keep evening school village ridiculous old woman limited mean unlimited infirmity sleep seven evening society youth pay penny week improve opportunity see rent small cottage wopsle room upstairs student overhear read aloud dignified terrific manner occasionally bump ceiling fiction wopsle examine scholar quarter occasion turn cuff stick hair mark antony oration body caesar follow collins ode passions particularly venerate wopsle revenge throw blood stain sword thunder take war denounce trumpet wither look late life fall society passions compare collins wopsle disadvantage gentleman
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,  kept in the same room—a little general shop. She had no idea what stock  she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a  little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a  Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop  transactions. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; I  confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what  relation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me,  too, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought,  in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing,  her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending  and pulling up at heel.

In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity  between seeds and corduroys.

The watchmaker, always  poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and  always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the  glass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the  High Street whose trade engaged his attention.",early morning arrival entertain speculation previous night send straight bed attic slope roof low corner bedstead calculate tile foot eyebrow early morning discover singular affinity seed corduroy pumblechook wear corduroy shopman general air flavour corduroy nature seed general air flavour seed nature corduroy hardly know opportunity serve noticing pumblechook appear conduct business look street saddler appear transact business keep eye coachmaker appear life put hand pocket contemplate baker turn fold arm stare grocer stand door yawn chemist watchmaker pore little desk magnifying glass eye inspect group smock frock poring glass shop window person high street trade engage attention

Besides being possessed by my  sister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be  imparted to my diet,—besides giving me as much crumb as possible in  combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm  water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the  milk out altogether,—his conversation consisted of nothing but  arithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,  pompously, “Seven times nine, boy?” And how should _I_ be able to  answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I  was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum  that lasted all through the breakfast. “Seven?” “And four?” “And  eight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on. And after each  figure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a  sup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,  and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)  a gorging and gormandizing manner.",pumblechook breakfast parlour shop shopman take mug tea hunch bread butter sack pea premise consider pumblechook wretche company possess sister idea mortifying penitential character ought imparted give crumb possible combination little butter put quantity warm water milk candid leave milk conversation consist arithmetic politely bid good morning say pompously seven time boy able answer dodge way strange place stomach hungry swallow morsel begin running sum last breakfast seven figure dispose bite sup come sit ease guess eat bacon hot roll allow expression gorging gormandizing manner
Dickens,Great Expectations,"For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we started  for Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the  manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady’s roof. Within a  quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s house, which was of old  brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the  windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were  rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so  we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to  open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.  Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), and  saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing  was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long  time.",reason glad come start miss havisham ease manner acquit lady roof quarter hour come miss havisham house old brick dismal great iron bar window wall remain low rustily bar courtyard bar wait ring bell come open wait gate peep pumblechook say fourteen pretend hear see house large brewery brewing go go long long time
Dickens,Great Expectations,"A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?” To which  my conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice returned, “Quite right,”  and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the  court-yard, with keys in her hand.",window raise clear voice demand conductor reply pumblechook voice return right window shut young lady come court yard key hand

Dickens,Great Expectations,"She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.  Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not  protest. But he eyed me severely,—as if _I_ had done anything to  him!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy! Let  your behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by  hand!” I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to  propound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But he didn’t.",say finally undiscussible way pumblechook condition ruffled dignity protest eye depart word reproachfully deliver boy let behaviour credit unto bring hand free apprehension come propound gate sixteen
Dickens,Great Expectations,"My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.  It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The  brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the  wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood  open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.  The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it  made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the  brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.",young conductress lock gate go courtyard paved clean grass grow crevice brewery building little lane communication wooden gate lane stand open brewery stood open away high enclose wall disuse cold wind blow cold outside gate shrill noise howl open side brewery like noise wind rigging ship sea

Dickens,Great Expectations,"We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two  chains across it outside,—and the first thing I noticed was, that the  passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.

It was a dressing-room, as I supposed  from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite  unknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded  looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady’s  dressing-table.",uncomfortable half afraid thing knock door knock tell enter enter find pretty large room light wax candle glimpse daylight see dressing room suppose furniture form use unknown prominent drape table gild looking glass sight fine lady dressing table

Dickens,Great Expectations,"She was dressed in rich materials,—satins, and lace, and silks,—all of  white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent  from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was  white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and  some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid  than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.  She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,—the  other was on the table near her hand,—her veil was but half arranged,  her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay  with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some  flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the  looking-glass.",dress rich lace white shoe white long white veil dependent hair bridal flower hair hair white bright jewel sparkle neck hand jewel lay sparkle table dress splendid dress wear half pack trunk scatter finished dress shoe table near veil half arrange watch chain lace bosom lay trinket handkerchief glove flower prayer book confusedly heap looking glass
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though  I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I  saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been  white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw  that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and  like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her  sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure  of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had  shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly  waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage  lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches  to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of  a vault under the church pavement.

I noticed that  Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had  taken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the  dressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now  yellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the  shoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now  yellow, had been trodden ragged.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure  that Miss Havisham’s face could not smile. It had dropped into a  watchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things about  her had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever lift  it up again.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She  put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and  meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in  disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—I  cannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its name  was,—that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the  girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of  them. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she  gave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having made  too sure that I was so wounded—and left me.",come bread meat little mug beer mug stone yard give bread meat look insolently dog disgrace humiliate hurt spurned offended angry hit right smart god know tear start eye moment spring girl look quick delight have cause give power look give contemptuous toss sense think have sure wound leave

Dickens,Great Expectations,"My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in  which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is  nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be  only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is  small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many  hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within  myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with  injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my  sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had  cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave  her no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,  disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had  nursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a  solitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was  morally timid and very sensitive.",sister bringing sensitive little world child existence whosoever bring finely perceive finely feel injustice small injustice child expose child small world small rocking horse stand hand high accord scale big boned irish hunter sustain babyhood perpetual conflict injustice know time speak sister capricious violent coercion unjust cherish profound conviction bring hand give right bring jerk punishment disgrace fast vigil penitential performance nurse assurance communing solitary unprotected way great refer fact morally timid sensitive
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the  brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my  face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the  brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high  wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there  had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no  pigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,  no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper  or the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have  evaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a  wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of  better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as  a sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I remember  those recluses as being like most others.",sure deserted place pigeon house brewery yard blow crooked pole high wind pigeon think sea pigeon rock pigeon dove cot horse stable pig sty malt storehouse smell grain beer copper vat use scent brewery evaporate reek smoke yard wilderness cask certain sour remembrance well day linger sour accept sample beer respect remember recluse like
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old  wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough  to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the  house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was  a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes  walked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But  she seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation  presented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking  on them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,  and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never  looked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery  itself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used  to make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I  first went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the  door looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and  ascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,  as if she were going out into the sky.",furth end brewery rank garden old wall high struggle hold long look rank garden garden house overgrown tangle weed track green yellow path walk estella walk away yield temptation present cask begin walk see walk end yard cask hold pretty brown hair spread hand look round pass view directly brewery mean large paved lofty place beer brewing utensil go oppress gloom stand near door look see pass extinguish fire ascend light iron stair gallery high overhead go sky
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened  to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a  stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes—a little dimmed by  looking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a low  nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure  hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one  shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded  trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was  Miss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if  she were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and  in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment  before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror  was greatest of all when I found no figure there.",place moment strange thing happen fancy think strange thing think strange thing long turn eye little dim look frosty light great wooden beam low nook building near right hand see figure hang neck figure yellow white shoe foot hang fade trimming dress like earthy paper face miss havisham movement go countenance try terror see figure terror certain moment run run terror great find figure
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of  people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving  influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have  brought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself  as soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to  let me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I  thought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.",frosty light cheerful sky sight people pass bar court yard gate reviving influence rest bread meat beer bring round aid come soon see estella approach key let fair reason look think see frighten fair reason

So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I  was wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to  our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply  revolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;  that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of  calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had  considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived  bad way.",laugh contemptuously push lock gate go straight pumblechook immensely relieve find home leave word shopman day want miss havisham set mile walk forge ponder go see deeply revolve common labouring boy hand coarse boot thick fall despicable habit call knave jack ignorant consider night generally low live bad way

I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s as  my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I  felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and  although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an  impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my  dragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before  the contemplation of Mrs. Joe.

Towards  Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat  debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham’s  acquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would “do  something” for me; their doubts related to the form that something  would take. My sister stood out for “property.” Mr. Pumblechook was in  favour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel  trade,—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the  deepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I  might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the  veal-cutlets. “If a fool’s head can’t express better opinions than  that,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had better  go and do it.” So he went.",see joe open blue eye roll round kitchen helpless amazement overtake penitence regard regard joe joe consider young monster sit debate result come miss havisham acquaintance favour doubt miss havisham doubt relate form sister stand property pumblechook favour handsome premium bind apprentice genteel corn seed trade instance joe fall deep disgrace offer bright suggestion present dog fight veal cutlet fool head express well opinion say sister get work well go

I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting  in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how  Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above  the level of such common doings.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,  that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to  get out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous  conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle’s  great-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to  get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she  would impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging  of girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her  promise within five minutes.",felicitous idea occur morning later wake good step make uncommon biddy know pursuance luminous conception mention biddy go wopsle great aunt night particular reason wish life feel oblige impart learn biddy obliging girl immediately say begin carry promise minute
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt  may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and  put straws down one another’s backs, until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt  collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with  a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,  the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand  to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a  little spelling,—that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this  volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state of  coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils  then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the  subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the  hardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a  rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they  had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more  illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have  since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various  specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part  of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between  Biddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave  out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—or  what we couldn’t—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,  shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or  reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had  lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt,  who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was  understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into  the air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that  there was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining himself with  a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not  easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of  the little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which was  also Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sitting-room and bedchamber—being but  faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle  and no snuffers.",educational scheme course establish wopsle great aunt resolve follow synopsis pupil eat apple straw back wopsle great aunt collect energy indiscriminate totter birch rod receive charge mark derision pupil form line buzzingly pass ragged book hand hand book alphabet figure table little soon volume begin circulate wopsle great aunt fall state coma arise sleep rheumatic paroxysm pupil enter competitive examination subject boots view ascertain tread hard toe mental exercise last biddy rush distribute defaced bible shape unskilfully cut chump end illegibly print good curiosity literature meet speckle ironmould have specimen insect world smash leave course usually lighten single combat biddy refractory student fight biddy give number page read aloud frightful chorus biddy lead high shrill monotonous voice have notion reverence read horrible din last certain time mechanically awake wopsle great aunt stagger boy fortuitously pull ear understand terminate course evening emerge air shriek intellectual victory fair remark prohibition pupil entertain slate ink easy pursue branch study winter season account little general shop class holden wopsle great aunt sitting room bedchamber faintly illuminated agency low spirited dip candle snuffer
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under  these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very  evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some  information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of  moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D  which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I  supposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.",appear time uncommon circumstance resolve try evening biddy enter special agreement impart information little catalogue price head moist sugar lend copy home large old english d imitate heading newspaper suppose tell design buckle

Dickens,Great Expectations,"He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it  he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause  before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,  which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on  Saturdays than at other times.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,  and holding tight to Joe.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"On the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk must  have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of  the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide  open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to  have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets  in the county.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the  strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the  guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of  conspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I had  previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed  me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed  myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday; and in  my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who  held it, and I screamed myself awake.",sadly break sleep get bed thinking strange man take aim invisible gun guiltily coarse common thing secret term conspiracy feature low career previously forget haunt file dread possess expect file reappear coax sleep think miss havisham wednesday sleep see file come door see hold scream awake
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my hesitating  ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting me,  as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage  where her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the  candle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously  saying, “You are to come this way to-day,” and took me to quite another  part of the house.",appoint time return miss havisham hesitating ring gate bring estella lock admit precede dark passage candle stand take notice candle hand look shoulder superciliously say come way day take house
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square  basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,  however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and  opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a  small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a  detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the  manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the  outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham’s room, and  like Miss Havisham’s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.",passage long pervade square basement manor house traverse square end stop candle open door daylight reappear find small paved courtyard opposite form detach dwelling house look belong manager head clerk extinct brewery clock outer wall house like clock miss havisham room like miss havisham watch stop minute
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a  low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in  the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, “You are to go and  stand there boy, till you are wanted.” “There”, being the window, I  crossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state of  mind, looking out.",go door stand open gloomy room low ceiling ground floor company room estella say join stand boy till want window cross stand uncomfortable state mind look

This  was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been  some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;  but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of  garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the  window, as if it pelted me for coming there.",open ground look miserable corner neglect garden rank ruin cabbage stalk box tree clip round long ago like pudding new growth shape different colour pudding stick saucepan get burn homely think contemplate box tree light snow overnight lie knowledge melt cold shadow bit garden wind catch little eddy throw window pelt come

Dickens,Great Expectations,"There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had  been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me  that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended  not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the  admission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to  be a toady and humbug.",lady room gentleman stand window minute convey toady humbug pretend know toady humbug admission know toady humbug
Dickens,Great Expectations,"They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure,  and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to  repress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded  me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I  found when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.  Indeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had  any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her  face.",listless dreary air wait somebody pleasure talkative lady speak rigidly repress yawn lady camilla remind sister difference old find catch sight blunter cast feature know well begin think mercy feature blank high dead wall face

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or  call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the  conversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!” On my turning  round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went  out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure!

He took my chin  in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the  light of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,  and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood up  bristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were  disagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and  strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he  had let them.

I wondered whether  he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be a doctor, or he  would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much  time to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham’s room,  where she and everything else were just as I had left them.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.  From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had  an airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in  the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than  to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed  colder than the clearer air,—like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry  branches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the  chamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its  darkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but  every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and  dropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a  tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the  house and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece  of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily  overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,  as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its  seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with  blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some  circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in  the spider community.",cross staircase landing enter room indicate room daylight completely exclude airless smell oppressive fire lately kindle damp old fashioned grate disposed burn reluctant smoke hang room cold clear marsh mist certain wintry branch candle high chimney piece faintly light chamber expressive faintly trouble darkness spacious dare handsome discernible thing cover dust mould drop piece prominent object long table tablecloth spread feast preparation house clock stop epergne centre piece kind middle cloth heavily overhung cobwebs form undistinguishable look yellow expanse remember grow like black fungus see speckle legged spider blotchy body run home run circumstance great public importance transpire spider community

After a  while she said, “Call Estella!” so I went out on the landing and roared  that name as I had done on the previous occasion.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an  instant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why have  you not begun?” With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as  before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham  watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella’s beauty, and  made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella’s breast and  hair.",length come distraught state degree instant miss havisham say let play card begin return room sit beggar miss havisham watch time direct attention estella beauty notice try jewel estella breast hair

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which  I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last  occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw  one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the  visitors out,—for she had returned with the keys in her hand,—I  strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a  wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,  which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of  weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a  weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.",purpose gate garden wall scramble peep occasion occasion open shut see gate see stand open know estella let visitor return key stroll garden stroll wilderness old melon frame cucumber frame decline produce spontaneous growth weak attempt piece old hat boot weedy offshoot likeness batter saucepan
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but  a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal  corner upon which I had looked out of the window.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt  morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have  had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to  consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I  followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by  the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking  me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he  begged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned  with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. “Available for  both,” he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to  pulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a  manner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.",secretly afraid see dexterous feel morally physically convince light head hair business pit stomach right consider irrelevant obtrude attention follow word retire nook garden form junction wall screen rubbish asking satisfied ground replying yes beg leave absent moment quickly return bottle water sponge dip vinegar available say place wall fall pull jacket waistcoat shirt manner light hearted business like bloodthirsty
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Although he did not look very healthy,—having pimples on his face, and  a breaking out at his mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalled  me. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he  had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For  the rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for  battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in  advance of the rest of him as to development.",look pimple face breaking dreadful preparation appal judge age tall way spin appearance rest young gentleman grey suit denude battle elbow knee wrist heel considerably advance rest development

Dickens,Great Expectations,"His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no  strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked  down; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or  drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in  seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air  and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at  last. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I  hit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and  again, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head  against the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and  turned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;  but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the  same time panting out, “That means you have won.”",spirit inspire great respect strength hit hard knock moment sponge drink water bottle great satisfaction second accord form come air believe go get heavily bruise sorry record hit hard hit come get bad fall head wall crisis affair get turn round round confusedly time know finally go knee sponge throw time pant mean win

Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.  The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman  on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the  more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt  that the pale young gentleman’s blood was on my head, and that the Law  would avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I  had incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go  stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and  pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves  open to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,  and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and  trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County  Jail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman’s nose had stained  my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the  dead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’s  teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I  devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance  when I should be haled before the Judges.",mind grow uneasy subject pale young gentleman think fight recall pale young gentleman stage puffy incrimsone countenance certain appear feel pale young gentleman blood head law avenge have definite idea penalty incur clear village boy stalk country ravage house gentlefolk pitch studious youth england lay open severe punishment day keep close home look kitchen door great caution trepidation go errand lest officer county jail pounce pale young gentleman nose stain trouser try wash evidence guilt dead night cut knuckle pale young gentleman tooth twist imagination thousand tangle devise incredible way account damnatory circumstance hale judges
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of  violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of  Justice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush  behind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal  vengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those  grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whether  suborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fall  upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was high  testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,  that I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; they  always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,  goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the  family features.",day come round return scene deed violence terror reach height myrmidon justice especially send london lie ambush miss havisham prefer personal vengeance outrage house rise grave clothe draw pistol shoot suborn boy numerous band mercenary engage fall brewery cuff high testimony confidence spirit pale young gentleman imagine accessory retaliation come mind act injudicious relative goad state visage indignant sympathy family feature
Dickens,Great Expectations,"However, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did. And behold!  nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way,  and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I  found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in  at the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped  by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner  where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the  young gentleman’s existence. There were traces of his gore in that  spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.",miss havisham behold come late struggle allude way pale young gentleman discover premise find gate open explore garden look window detach house view suddenly stop closed shutter lifeless corner combat take place detect evidence young gentleman existence trace gore spot cover garden mould eye man
Dickens,Great Expectations,"On the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and that other  room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—a  light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed  there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular  occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired  of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and  across the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over  again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as  long as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general  mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled  that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,  and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten  months.",broad landing miss havisham room room long table lay see garden light chair wheel push place visit enter day regular occupation push miss havisham chair tired walk hand shoulder round room landing round room journey long hour stretch insensibly fall general mention journey numerous settle return alternate day noon purpose go sum period month
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more  to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I  going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I  believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know  everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that  desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer  my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anything  but my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my  services.",begin miss havisham talk ask question learn go tell go apprentice joe believe enlarge know want know hope offer help desirable end contrary prefer ignorant daily stipulate pay service
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told  me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;  sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite  familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she  hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we  were alone, “Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?” And when I said  yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when  we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish  of Estella’s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods  were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled  what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish  fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like “Break their  hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”",estella let tell kiss coldly tolerate condescend familiar tell energetically hate miss havisham ask whisper grow pretty pretty pip say yes enjoy greedily play card miss havisham look miserly relish estella mood mood contradictory puzzle miss havisham embrace lavish fondness murmur ear sound like break heart pride hope break heart mercy
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which  the burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of  rendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in  that relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure  of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the  introduction of Old Clem’s respected name. Thus, you were to hammer  boys round—Old Clem! With a thump and a sound—Old Clem! Beat it out,  beat it out—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout—Old Clem! Blow the  fire, blow the fire—Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem!  One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly  saying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, “There,  there, there! Sing!” I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I  pushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that she  took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.  After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,  and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so  subdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in  the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.",song joe hum fragment forge burden old clem ceremonious way render homage patron saint believe old clem stand relation smith song imitate measure beat iron mere lyrical excuse introduction old clem respected hammer boy round old clem thump sound old clem beat beat old clem clink stout old clem blow fire blow fire old clem roaring dryer soar high old clem day soon appearance chair miss havisham suddenly say impatient movement finger sing surprised croon ditty push floor happen catch fancy take low brooding voice singe sleep customary move estella join strain subdue noise grim old house light breath wind

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had  not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I  had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly  fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger  to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of  him. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella  discussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more  potent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but  Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to  do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did  not know then, though I think I know now.",tell joe pale young gentleman previously betray enormous invention confess circumstance feel joe hardly fail discern pale young gentleman appropriate passenger black velvet coach say shrink have miss havisham estella discuss come beginning grow potent time go repose complete confidence biddy tell poor biddy come natural biddy deep concern tell know think know
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost  insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,  Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of  discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to  this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these  hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would  have done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of  mind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before  him,—as it were, to operate upon,—and he would drag me up from my stool  (usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me  before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,  “Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by  hand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which  so did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!” And then he would  rumple my hair the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, as  already hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any  fellow-creature to do,—and would hold me before him by the sleeve,—a  spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.",council go kitchen home fraught insupportable aggravation exasperate spirit ass pumblechook come night purpose discuss prospect sister believe hour penitence ought feel hand take linchpin chaise cart miserable man man confine stolidity mind discuss prospect have operate drag stool usually collar quiet corner put fire go cook begin say mum boy boy bring hand hold head boy forever grateful unto mum respection boy rumple hair wrong early remembrance hint soul deny right fellow creature hold spectacle imbecility equal
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations  about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,  that I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, fly  at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister  spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at  every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,  would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of  my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.",sister pair nonsensical speculation miss havisham want painfully burst spiteful tear fly pumblechook pummel dialogue sister speak morally wrench tooth reference pumblechook self constitute patron sit supervise depreciatory eye like architect fortune think engage unremunerative job
Dickens,Great Expectations,"In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,  while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe’s perceiving that he  was not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old  enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on  his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my  sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into  opposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out  of his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating  end to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to  lead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching  sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, “Come!  there’s enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_’ve given trouble  enough for one night, I hope!” As if I had besought them as a favour to  bother my life out.",discussion joe bear talk progress reason joe perceive favourable take forge fully old apprentice joe joe sit poker knee thoughtfully rake ashe low bar sister distinctly construe innocent action opposition dive poker hand shake away irritating end debate moment lead sister stop yawn catch sight incidentally swoop come bed give trouble night hope beseech favour bother life

Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister  “went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previous  period. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats  under our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we  graciously thought she _was_ fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent  of such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud  sobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put on  her coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not  satisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,  and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the  back-yard. It was ten o’clock at night before we ventured to creep in  again, and then she asked Joe why he hadn’t married a Negress Slave at  once? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker  and looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have  been a better speculation.",get home night deliver message joe sister go rampage alarming degree previous period ask joe suppose door mat foot dare use company graciously think fit exhaust torrent inquiry throw candlestick joe burst loud sobbing get bad coarse apron begin clean terrible extent satisfy dry cleaning take pail scrubbing brush clean house home stand shiver yard night venture creep ask joe marry negress slave joe offer answer poor fellow stand feel whisker look dejectedly think well speculation
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe  arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss  Havisham’s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the  occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in  his working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so  dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for  me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the  hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.",trial feeling day joe array sunday clothe accompany miss havisham think court suit necessary occasion tell look far well working dress know dreadfully uncomfortable entirely account pull shirt collar high hair crown head stand like tuft feather

The forge was shut up for the  day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to  do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable  HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the  direction he had taken.",breakfast time sister declare intention go town leave uncle pumblechook call fine way put case joe appear inclined augur bad forge shut day joe inscribe chalk door custom rare occasion work monosyllable hout accompany sketch arrow suppose fly direction take

I was quite  as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that  after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe  while my indentures lasted.

It is not possible  to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing  man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it  has touched one’s self in going by, and I know right well that any good  that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented  Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.",include proceed add merit proceed add joe faithful joe faithful run away go soldier sailor strong sense virtue industry joe strong sense virtue industry work tolerable zeal grain possible know far influence amiable honest hearted duty man fly world possible know touch self go know right good intermix apprenticeship come plain content joe restlessly aspire discontent

I was haunted by the fear that she  would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing  the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. He  pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,—a clear Impossibility,—but  he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to  have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to  have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its  understanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of  great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even  seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by  mere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his  dinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the  Wandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention  of ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper’s out on the marshes,  and on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his  hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his  neck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the  sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,  locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or  otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,  half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it  was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.",joe keep journeyman weekly wage orlick pretend christian clear fellow obstinate disposition believe prey delusion particular wilfully impose village affront understanding broadshouldered loose limbed swarthy fellow great strength hurry slouch come work purpose slouch mere accident go jolly bargemen eat dinner go away night slouch like cain wandering jew idea go intention come lodge sluice keeper marsh working day come slouch hermitage hand pocket dinner loosely tie bundle round neck dangle sundays lay day sluice gate stand rick barn slouch locomotively eye ground accost require raise look half resentful half puzzled way thought odd injurious fact think
Dickens,Great Expectations,"This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and  timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner  of the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was  necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,  and that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe’s ’prentice,  Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace  him; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,  or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he  always beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old  Clem, he came in out of time.",morose journeyman liking small timid give understand devil live black corner forge know fiend necessary fire seven year live boy consider fuel joe prentice orlick confirm suspicion displace howbeit like say openly import hostility notice beat spark direction sing old clem come time

Oh! oh! oh!” Each of these exclamations  was a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of  all the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for  her, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she  consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself  into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; “what was the  name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me?

Oh!” Here my sister, after a fit of clappings  and screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and  threw her cap off, and pulled her hair down,—which were the last stages  on her road to frenzy.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical  interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he  meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether  he was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation  admitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence  straightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt  aprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in  that neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.  Orlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young  gentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come  out of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had  dropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I  think), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was  recommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her  hands in Joe’s hair. Then came that singular calm and silence which  succeed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have  always connected with such a lull,—namely, that it was Sunday, and  somebody was dead,—I went upstairs to dress myself.",wretched joe disregarded parenthetical interruption stand journeyman ask mean interfere betwixt joe man come old orlick feel situation admit come defence straightway pull singe burn apron go like giant man neighbourhood stand uplong joe see man orlick account pale young gentleman soon coal dust hurry come joe unlock door pick sister drop insensible window see fight think carry house lay recommend revive struggle clench hand joe hair come singular calm silence succeed uproar vague sensation connect sunday somebody go upstairs dress
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any  other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick’s nostrils,  which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared  from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a  peaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence  on Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting  observation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off the  Rampage, Pip:—such is Life!”",come find joe orlick sweep trace discomposure slit orlick nostril expressive ornamental pot beer appear jolly bargemen share turn peaceable manner lull sedative philosophical influence joe follow road parting observation good rampage pip rampage life

Dickens,Great Expectations,"As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at  the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,  who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in  his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that  moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on  the head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner  did he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence  had put a ’prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,  and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I  knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the  way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better  than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into  Pumblechook’s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.",loiter high street look disconsolately shop window think buy gentleman come bookshop wopsle wopsle hand affect tragedy george barnwell moment invest sixpence view heap word head pumblechook go drink tea soon appear consider special providence prentice way read lay hold insist accompany pumblechookian parlour know miserable home night dark way dreary companionship road well great resistance consequently turn pumblechook street shop light
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I  don’t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it  took until half-past nine o’ clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle  got into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he  became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful  career. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being  cut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to  seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was  a mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the  identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When  Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively  apologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,  too, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and  maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating  circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every  occasion; it became sheer monomania in my master’s daughter to care a  button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating  conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general  feebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle  had closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his  head, and saying, “Take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were a  well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided  I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.",assist representation george barnwell know long usually know take half past o clock night wopsle get newgate think scaffold slow period disgraceful career think little complain cut short flower run seed leaf leaf course begin mere question length wearisomeness sting identification affair unoffending self barnwell begin wrong declare feel positively apologetic pumblechook indignant stare tax wopsle take pain present bad light ferocious maudlin murder uncle extenuating circumstance millwood argument occasion sheer monomania master daughter care button gasping procrastinating conduct fatal morning worthy general feebleness character happily hang wopsle close book pumblechook sit stare shake head say warning boy warning know fact contemplate murder near relation provide induce weakness benefactor
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with  Mr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out,  and it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of  the lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance  on the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose  with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we  came upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.",dark night set wopsle walk home town find heavy mist fall wet thick turnpike lamp blur lamp usual place apparently ray look solid substance fog notice say mist rise change wind certain quarter marsh come man slouch lee turnpike house

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in  silence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’s  tragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,  with his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very  dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the  sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled  sulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my  thoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game  on Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us  past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find—it being  eleven o’clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and  unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered  about.

It was full of people; the whole  village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there  was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst  of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,  and so I became aware of my sister,—lying without sense or movement on  the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on  the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was  turned towards the fire,—destined never to be on the Rampage again,  while she was the wife of Joe.",run fast admit say stop get kitchen people village yard surgeon joe group woman floor midst kitchen unemployed bystander draw see aware sense movement bare board knock tremendous blow head deal unknown hand face turn rampage wife joe
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to  believe that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,  or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under  obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than  any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began  to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all  sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.",head george barnwell dispose believe hand attack sister event near relation popularly know obligation legitimate object suspicion clear light morning begin reconsider matter hear discuss side take view case reasonable
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a  quarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten. While he was  there, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had  exchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not  be more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into  dense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been  before nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found  her struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The  fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle  very long; the candle, however, had been blown out.",joe jolly bargemen smoke pipe quarter quarter sister see stand kitchen door exchange good night farm labourer go home man particular time see get dense confusion try joe go home minute find strike floor promptly call assistance fire burn unusually low snuff candle long candle blow
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond  the blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the door  and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and  was struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such  as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one  remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with  something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were  dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable  violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when  Joe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron which had been filed  asunder.",take away house blowing stand table door sister stand face fire disarrangement kitchen except fall bleeding remarkable piece evidence spot strike blunt heavy head spine blow deal heavy throw considerable violence lie face ground joe pick convict leg iron file asunder
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to have  been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the  Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s opinion was  corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the  prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they  claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been  worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,  one of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his  iron.",joe examine iron smith eye declare file asunder time ago hue cry go hulks people come examine iron joe opinion corroborate undertake leave prison ship undoubtedly belong claim know certain particular manacle wear convict escape night retake free iron

I believed  the iron to be my convict’s iron,—the iron I had seen and heard him  filing at, on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse him of having put  it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have  become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.

There was nothing against  him, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with  everybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if  he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no  dispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore  them. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in  so silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could  look round.",orlick go town exactly tell pick turnpike see town evening diver company public house come wopsle save quarrel sister quarrel everybody thousand time strange man come bank note dispute sister fully prepared restore altercation assailant come silently suddenly fell look round
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however  undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered  unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I  should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the  story. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally  in the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The  contention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old one  now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not  tear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much  mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me  if he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not  believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets  as a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of  course—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing  is always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see  any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of  the assailant.",horrible think provide weapon undesignedly hardly think suffer unspeakable trouble consider reconsider dissolve spell childhood tell joe story month day settle question finally negative reopen reargue morning contention come secret old grow tear away addition dread have lead mischief likely alienate joe believe restraining dread believe assort fabulous dog veal cutlet monstrous invention temporize course waver right wrong thing resolve disclosure new occasion new chance help discovery assailant
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The Constables and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened in  the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house for  a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like  authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously  wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,  and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead  of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood  about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks  that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a  mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as  taking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.",constables bow street man london happen day extinct red waistcoated police house week pretty hear read like authority case take obviously wrong people run head hard wrong idea persist try fit circumstance idea instead try extract idea circumstance stand door jolly bargemen know reserve look fill neighbourhood admiration mysterious manner take drink good take culprit
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay  very ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects  multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of  the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and  her speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as  to be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always  by her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate  in speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than  indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,  extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always  called in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,  the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among  the mildest of my own mistakes.",long constitutional power disperse sister lie ill bed sight disturb see object multiply grasp visionary teacup wineglass instead reality hearing greatly impaired memory speech unintelligible come round far help downstair necessary slate indicate write indicate speech bad handwriting apart indifferent speller joe indifferent reader extraordinary complication arise call solve administration mutton instead medicine substitution tea joe baker bacon mild mistake
Dickens,Great Expectations,"However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A  tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part  of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three  months, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then  remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We  were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a  circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It may have been about a month after my sister’s reappearance in the  kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the  whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.  Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly  cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had  been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me  every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a fine  figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking the  cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe  became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,  and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that  did him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had  all more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that  they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest  spirits they had ever encountered.",month sister reappearance kitchen biddy come small speckled box contain worldly effect blessing household blessing joe dear old fellow sadly cut constant contemplation wreck wife accustom attend evening turn blue eye moisten fine figure woman pip biddy instantly take clever charge study infancy joe able sort appreciate great quiet life jolly bargemen change good characteristic police people suspect poor joe know man concur deep spirit encounter

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a  character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost  eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly  wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,  from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the  sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my  sister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a  qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one  after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the  shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and  displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook  her head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified  lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.",sister trace slate character look like curious t utmost eagerness call attention particularly want vain try producible begin t tar toast tub length come head sign look like hammer lustily call word sister ear begin hammer table express qualified assent bring hammer avail bethought crutch shape borrow village display sister considerable confidence shake head extent show terrify lest weak shattered state dislocate neck
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this  mysterious sign reappeared on the slate.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was  disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest  anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his  being at length produced, and motioned that she would have him given  something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were  particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his  reception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and  there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have  seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that  day, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate,  and without Orlick’s slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as  if he knew no more than I did what to make of it.",confess expect sister denounce disappoint different result manifest great anxiety good term evidently pleased length produce motion give drink watch countenance particularly wishful assure take kindly reception show possible desire conciliate air humble propitiation see pervade bearing child hard master day day rarely pass draw hammer slate orlick slouching stand doggedly know
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was  varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more  remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying  another visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty  at the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she  spoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.  The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I  was going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention  at once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking  the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than  causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after  that, I took it.",fall regular routine apprenticeship life varied limit village marsh remarkable circumstance arrival birthday pay visit miss havisham find miss sarah pocket duty gate find miss havisham leave speak estella way word interview last minute give guinea go tell come birthday mention annual custom try decline take guinea occasion well effect cause ask angrily expect take
Dickens,Great Expectations,"So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened  room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that  I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that  mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew  older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my  thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.

She was not beautiful,—she was common, and could not  be like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.

For I called to mind now, that she was  equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our  different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I  knew, Biddy knew.

I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been  until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of  living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled  the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the  miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,  with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and  shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must  have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first  uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of  course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I  looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps  I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy.

When we had passed  the village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the  marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I  began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my  usual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,  with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it  would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time  and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.",sister leave joe readily undertook care sunday afternoon biddy go summer time lovely weather pass village church churchyard marsh begin sail ship sail begin combine miss havisham estella prospect usual way come river sit bank water ripple foot make quiet sound resolve good time place admission biddy inner confidence

I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and  wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing  beggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stopped  clocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good  for me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those  remembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish  what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked  myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were  beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?

At those times, I would decide conclusively that my  disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was  growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company  with Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the  Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and  scatter my wits again.

When I  got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a  mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,  for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even  at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind  between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in  so often between the forge and Miss Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella.",biddy say handsomely forgive soon exchange affectionate good night joe go bed get little room sit take long look mean little room soon part raise furnish fresh young remembrance moment fall confused division mind well room go forge miss havisham biddy estella

As I put the window open and stood looking out, I  saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or  two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and  light it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me  that he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.",sun shine brightly day roof attic room warm window open stand look see joe come slowly forth dark door turn air see biddy come bring pipe light smoke late hint want comfort reason
Dickens,Great Expectations,"He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his  pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew  that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing  tone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for  more, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and  sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and  strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the  loneliest I had ever known.",presently stand door immediately beneath smoke pipe biddy stand quietly talk know talk hear mention endearing tone listen hear draw away window sit chair bedside feel sorrowful strange night bright fortune loneliest know
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s pipe  floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—not  obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared  together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy  bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.",look open window see light wreath joe pipe float fancy like blessing obtrude parade pervade air share light creep bed uneasy bed sleep old sound sleep
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,  and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay  heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened  between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a  misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and  that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or  clean gone.",morning considerable difference general prospect life brighten scarcely lay heavy mind consideration day intervene day departure divest misgiving happen london get greatly deteriorate clean gone
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our  approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After  breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best  parlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With  all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,  and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about the  rich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.",joe biddy sympathetic pleasant speak approach separation refer breakfast joe bring indenture press good parlour fire feel free novelty emancipation go church joe think clergyman read rich man kingdom heaven know
Dickens,Great Expectations,"After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off  the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I  felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion  for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after  Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the  low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them  one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner  of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of  condescension, upon everybody in the village.",early dinner stroll purpose finish marsh pass church feel feel service morning sublime compassion poor creature destine sunday sunday life lie obscurely low green mound promise day form plan outline bestow dinner roast beef plum pudding pint ale gallon condescension everybody village
Dickens,Great Expectations,"If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my  companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among  those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place  recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and  badge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he  had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to  me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.",think ally shame companionship fugitive see limping grave thought sunday place recall wretch ragged shivering felon iron badge comfort happen long time ago doubtless transport long way dead veritably dead bargain
Dickens,Great Expectations,"No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these  grazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a  more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might  stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great  expectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,  henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith’s work in  general, and for you!

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily secure of  me. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,  “It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort. Therefore, I made  no remark on Joe’s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the  tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a  gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I  were one.",well pleased joe mightily secure like betray emotion say credit pip sort remark joe head merely say second tiding come suddenly want gentleman speculate

Dickens,Great Expectations,"What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to  do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had  been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly  innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to  Biddy in preference.",mean come property able joe agreeable well qualified rise station perfectly innocent meaning think mention biddy preference
Dickens,Great Expectations,"So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our  little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a  general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never  forget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.",walk home tea take biddy little garden lane throw general way elevation spirit forget say favour ask

Yet a gentleman should not be  unjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.",scold approve return poor biddy equally depend try lie power time opinion away shall difference remembrance gentleman unjust say biddy turn away head
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in  which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to  think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,  and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and  took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very  sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright  fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.",warmly repeat bad human nature sentiment waive application see reason think right walk little path away biddy biddy go house go garden gate take dejected stroll supper time feel sorrowful strange second night bright fortune lonely unsatisfactory
Dickens,Great Expectations,"But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency  to Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I  had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,  and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his  breakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think it  worth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.",morning brighten view extend clemency biddy drop subject put good clothe go town early hope find shop open present trabb tailor have breakfast parlour shop think worth come call

Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?”",dear sir say trabb respectfully bend body open arm take liberty touch outside elbow hurt mention venture congratulate favour step shop
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.  When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his  labours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into  the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible  corners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with  any blacksmith, alive or dead.",trabb boy audacious boy country enter sweep shop sweeten labour sweep sweeping come shop trabb knock broom possible corner obstacle express understand equality blacksmith alive dead

Now,  this,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out  in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand  under it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article. I can recommend  it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you  shall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!” (To the boy, and with  a dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’s  brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)",hold noise say trabb great sternness knock head favour seat sir say trabb take roll cloth tide flow manner counter preparatory get hand gloss sweet article recommend purpose sir extra sup shall number boy dreadfully severe stare foresee danger miscreant brush make sign familiarity
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had  deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.  Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. “And let  me have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb, “or you shall repent  it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”",trabb remove stern eye boy deposit number counter safe distance command bring number number let trick say trabb shall repent young scoundrel long day live
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential  confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an  article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it  would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished  fellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having  worn. “Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mr.  Trabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop and  bring them myself?”",trabb bend number sort deferential confidence recommend light article summer wear article vogue nobility gentry article honour reflect distinguished fellow townsman claim fellow townsman have worn bring number vagabond say trabb boy shall kick shop bring
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb’s  judgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.  Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented  with it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existing  circumstances, sir,—wouldn’t do at all.” So, Mr. Trabb measured and  calculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest  species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I  felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his  pains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles  to Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand  upon the parlour lock, “I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be  expected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a  turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem  it.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what  it meant.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"After this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and the  bootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’s  dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went  to the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday  morning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come  into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,  it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention  diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his  mind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my  steps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached that gentleman’s  place of business, I saw him standing at his door.",memorable event go hatter bootmaker hosier feel like mother hubbard dog outfit require service trade go coach office take place seven saturday morning necessary explain come handsome property say effect follow officiating tradesman cease attention divert window high street concentrate mind order want direct step pumblechook approach gentleman place business see stand door

I  mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,  and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he  intimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he? Then he  asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we  had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he  had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken  ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he  never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of  hearts have repudiated the idea.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask  my advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was  an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and  seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred  before in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting to  the realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.  Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him  (Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through  a sleeping partner, sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing to  do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the  books,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his  pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that that  might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with  property, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?  He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it  as my opinion. “Wait a bit!” The united vastness and distinctness of  this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake  hands with me, but said he really must,—and did.",degree fall repose great confidence ask advice reference affair mention opportunity great amalgamation monopoly corn seed trade premise enlarge occur neighbourhood want realisation vast fortune consider capital little word capital appear pumblechook capital get business sleeping partner sleeping partner walk self deputy please examine walk twice year profit away pocket tune appear opening young gentleman spirit combine property worthy attention think great confidence opinion think give opinion wait bit united vastness distinctness view strike long ask shake hand say
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and  over again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know what mark), and  to render me efficient and constant service (I don’t know what  service). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and  certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had  always said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun’  will be no common fortun’.” He said with a tearful smile that it was a  singular thing to think of now, and I said so too.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I  went to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to  Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was given up to me to dress  in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My  clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and  eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a  trifle short of the wearer’s expectation. But after I had had my new  suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of  posturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s very limited dressing-glass, in the  futile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being  market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.  Pumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to  leave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before  departing. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new  array, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious  after all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe’s  in his Sunday suit.",tuesday wednesday thursday pass friday morning go pumblechook new clothe pay visit miss havisham pumblechook room give dress decorate clean towel expressly event clothe disappointment course probably new eagerly expect garment clothe come fall trifle short wearer expectation new suit half hour go immensity posturing pumblechook limited dressing glass futile endeavour leg fit well market morning neighbouring town mile pumblechook home tell exactly mean leave likely shake hand depart go new array fearfully ashamed have pass shopman suspicious personal disadvantage like joe sunday suit

Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.  Jaggers’s instructions.” She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and  Sarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.  “Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.”",gloat question answer keen enjoyment sarah pocket jealous dismay go promising career good deserve abide jaggers instruction look look sarah sarah countenance wring watchful face cruel smile good bye pip know

I said “Good-bye, Miss Pocket;” but she merely stared, and  did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the  house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook’s, took off my new  clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,  carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I had  the bundle to carry.",sarah pocket conduct ghost see appearance degree confound say good bye miss pocket merely stare collect know speak clear house good way pumblechook take new clothe bundle go home old dress carry speak truth ease bundle carry
Dickens,Great Expectations,"And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run  out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more  steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled  away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more  appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I  dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my  splendour	 until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,  graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish  with.

I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my sense  of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the  coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of  this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on  this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had  an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in  the morning.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places  instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now  pigs, now men,—never horses.

But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking  of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go  downstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and  unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,  until Biddy called to me that I was late.",biddy astir early breakfast sleep window hour smell smoke kitchen fire start terrible idea late afternoon long long hear clinking teacup ready want resolution downstair remain repeatedly unlock unstrappe small portmanteau lock strap biddy call late
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,  saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,  “Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who was  laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,  and threw my arms around Joe’s neck. Then I took up my little  portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I  presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing  an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped  then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above  his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her  face.",hurried breakfast taste get meal say sort briskness occur suppose kiss sister laugh nod shake usual chair kiss biddy throw arm joe neck take little portmanteau walk see presently hear scuffle look see joe throw old shoe biddy throw old shoe stop wave hat dear old joe wave strong right arm head cry huskily hooroar biddy apron face
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had  supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to  have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High  Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very  peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to  show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all  beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave  and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the  village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, “Good-bye, O my dear,  dear friend!”",walk away good pace think easy suppose reflect old shoe throw coach sight high street whistle go village peaceful quiet light mist solemnly rise world innocent little unknown great moment strong heave sob break tear finger post end village lay hand say good bye o dear dear friend

We changed, and I had not made  up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite  practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and  he had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield, and close  by the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to  have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed  me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier  of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on  his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old  weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a  work of time.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Jaggers’s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most  dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,  and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted  themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers  about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd  objects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an old  rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and  packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly  swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backed  chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,  like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and  bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the  clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the  wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’s chair, being greasy with  shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled  forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being  turned out.",jaggers room light skylight dismal place skylight eccentrically pitch like broken head distorted adjoining house look twist peep paper expect odd object expect old rusty pistol sword scabbard strange look box package dreadful cast shelf face peculiarly swollen twitchy nose jaggers high back chair deadly black horsehair row brass nail round like coffin fancy lean bite forefinger client room small client habit back wall wall especially opposite jaggers chair greasy shoulder recall eyed gentleman shuffle forth wall innocent cause turn
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’s  chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I  called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to  everybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many  other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have  the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what  was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came  there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers’s  family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such  ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the  blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.  Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits  may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and  grit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in  Mr. Jaggers’s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts  on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’s chair, and got up and went out.",sit cliental chair place jaggers chair fascinated dismal atmosphere place call mind clerk air know everybody disadvantage master wonder clerk upstairs claim detrimental mastery fellow creature wonder history odd litter room come wonder swollen face jaggers family unfortunate pair ill look relation stick dusty perch black fly settle instead give place home course experience london summer day spirit oppress hot exhausted air dust grit lie thick sit wonder wait jaggers close room bear cast shelf jaggers chair get go
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I  waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into  Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being  all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to  me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a  street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at me  from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate  Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered  with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and  from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits  and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.",tell clerk turn air wait advise round corner come smithfield come smithfield shameful place asmear filth fat blood foam stick rub possible speed turn street see great black dome saint paul bulging grim stone building bystander say newgate prison follow wall jail find roadway cover straw deaden noise pass vehicle quantity people stand smell strongly spirit beer infer trial
Dickens,Great Expectations,"While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk  minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a  trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half  a crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice  in his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and  presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I  declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as  to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also  where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors’  Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest  of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on ’em”  would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the  morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a  sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’s  proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his  pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not  belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had  bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought  myself well rid of him for a shilling.",look exceedingly dirty partially drunk minister justice ask like step hear trial inform place half crown command view lord chief justice wig awful personage like waxwork presently offer reduce price eighteen penny decline proposal plea appointment good yard gallow keep people publicly whip show debtors door culprit come hang heighten interest dreadful portal give understand come door day morrow morning kill row horrible give sickening idea london lord chief justice proprietor wear hat boot pocket handkerchief inclusive mildew clothe evidently belong originally take head buy cheap executioner circumstance think rid shilling
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I  found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour  of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became  aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as  I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew  Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the  pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when  they first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.”  There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and  one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted  her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggers  is for him, ’Melia, and what more _could_ you have?” There was a  red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering  there, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;  and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a  highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a  lamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the  words, “O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,  give me Jaggerth!” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian  made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than  ever.",drop office ask jaggers come find stroll time tour little britain turn bartholomew close aware people wait jaggers man secret appearance lounge bartholomew close thoughtfully fit foot crack pavement talk say pass jagger knot man woman stand corner woman cry dirty shawl comfort say pull shawl shoulder jagger melia red eyed little jew come close loitering company second little jew send errand messenger go remark jew highly excitable temperament perform jig anxiety lamp post accompany kind frenzy word o jaggerth jaggerth jaggerth otherth ith cag maggerth jaggerth testimony popularity guardian deep impression admire wonder

Dickens,Great Expectations,"My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,  standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed  to bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements  he had made for me. I was to go to “Barnard’s Inn,” to young Mr.  Pocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I  was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go  with him to his father’s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked  it. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberal  one,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian’s drawers, the cards  of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,  and such other things as I could in reason want. “You will find your  credit good, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt  like a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall by  this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find  you outrunning the constable. Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, but  that’s no fault of mine.”",guardian take room lunch standing sandwich box pocket flask sherry bully sandwich eat inform arrangement barnard inn young pocket room bed send accommodation remain young pocket monday monday father house visit try like tell allowance liberal hand guardian drawer card certain tradesman deal kind clothe thing reason want find credit good pip say guardian flask sherry smelt like caskful hastily refresh shall mean able check bill pull find outrunning constable course wrong fault

Another clerk  was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I  accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.  We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way  among them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it’s no use; he  won’t have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them,  and went on side by side.",find wemmick clerk room clerk ring upstairs place accompany street shake hand guardian find new set people linger outside wemmick way say coolly decisively tell use wo word soon get clear go
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was  like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in  stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have  been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some  marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been  softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.  The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment  over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them  off. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his  linen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for  he wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a  lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,  that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were  quite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering  eyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips. He had had  them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.",cast eye wemmick go like light day find dry man short stature square wooden face expression imperfectly chip dull edge chisel mark dimple material soft instrument finer dint chisel attempt embellishment nose give effort smooth judge bachelor fray condition linen appear sustain good bereavement wear mourning ring brooch represent lady weeping willow tomb urn notice ring seal hang watch chain laden remembrance departed friend glitter keen thin wide mottled lip good belief year

My depression was not  alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment  to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town  was a mere public-house.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an  introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me  like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in  it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the  most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever  seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those  houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and  curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable  makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,  as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of  Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the  present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy  mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,  and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and  humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry  rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and  cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand  besides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,  “Try Barnard’s Mixture.”",enter haven wicket gate disgorge introductory passage melancholy little square look like flat burying ground think dismal tree dismal sparrow dismal cat dismal house number half dozen see think window set chamber house divide stage dilapidated blind curtain crippled flower pot crack glass dusty decay miserable makeshift let let let glare room new wretch come vengeance soul barnard slowly appease gradual suicide present occupant unholy interment gravel frowzy mourning soot smoke attire forlorn creation barnard strew ashe head undergo penance humiliation mere dust hole far sense sight dry rot wet rot silent rot rot neglect roof rat mouse bug coaching stable near hand address faintly sense smell moan try barnard mixture

He had not a handsome face,  but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.  His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had  taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be  light and young.

It was a  nice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor’s Feast,—and it  acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent  circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.  This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the  banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have  said, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from the  coffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a  comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter  the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell  over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the  bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into  my bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butter  in a state of congelation when I retired for the night.

It  is scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as other people  do. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This  has two advantages.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls,  or anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to Miss  Havisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,  before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that  he was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he  was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a  gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a  principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever  was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no  varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you  put on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued  Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe  she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the  susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she  passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized  him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got  great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out  of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his  father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband  he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in  Miss Havisham’s counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love  to be advised by any one.

We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the  course of conversation, what he was?

Dickens,Great Expectations,"This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;  very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded  to his manner of bearing that defeat.

The space interposed between myself and them  partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That  I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on  the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of  impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the  London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the  dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I  had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of  night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning  about Barnard’s Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my  heart.",moderate computation month sunday leave joe biddy space interpose partook expansion marsh distance old church old church go clothe sunday combination impossibility geographical social solar lunar london street crowd people brilliantly light dusk evening depress hint reproach poor old kitchen home far away dead night footstep incapable impostor porter moon barnard inn pretence watch fall hollow heart
Dickens,Great Expectations,"On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the  counting-house to report himself,—to look about him, too, I  suppose,—and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two  to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It  appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched  were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging  from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday  morning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my  eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,  of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another  back second floor, rather than a look out.",monday morning quarter herbert go counting house report look bear company come away hour attend hammersmith wait appear egg young insurers hatch incubate dust heat like egg ostrich judge place incipient giant repair monday morning counting house herbert assist eye good observatory second floor yard grimy presence particular look second floor look
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change, and I saw  fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to  be great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they should all be  out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a  celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have  been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help  noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths  and knives and waiters’ clothes, than in the steaks. This collation  disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not  charged for), we went back to Barnard’s Inn and got my little  portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at  two or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk  to Mr. Pocket’s house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct  into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket’s children  were playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my  interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.  and Mrs. Pocket’s children were not growing up or being brought up, but  were tumbling up.",wait noon go change see fluey man sit bill shipping take great merchant understand spirit herbert come go lunch celebrate house venerate believe abject superstition europe help noticing gravy tablecloth knife waiter clothe steak collation dispose moderate price consider grease charge go barnard inn get little portmanteau take coach hammersmith arrive afternoon little way walk pocket house lift latch gate pass direct little garden overlook river pocket child play deceive point interest prepossession certainly concern see pocket child grow bring tumble

Her countenance  immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been  reading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,  she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quite  well?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I  began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such  person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have  been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the  nurse came to my rescue.",time nurse pick pocket handkerchief say time drop mum pocket laugh say thank flopson settle chair resume book countenance immediately assume knitted intent expression read week read half dozen line fix eye say hope mamma unexpected inquiry difficulty begin say absurdest way person doubt oblige send compliment nurse come rescue

I was at a loss to account for  this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to  speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,  which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.  Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby  and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.",wait suppose pocket come rate wait opportunity observe remarkable family phenomenon child stray near pocket play trip tumble momentary astonishment enduring lamentation loss account surprising circumstance help give mind speculation miller come baby baby hand flopson flopson hand pocket go fairly head foremost pocket baby catch herbert

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a  little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had  lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders  that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to  see him. “For, I really am not,” he added, with his son’s smile, “an  alarming personage.” He was a young-looking man, in spite of his  perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite  natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;  there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would  have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was  very near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to  Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which  were black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?”  And she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes.” She then smiled upon  me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of  orange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on  any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been  thrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational  condescension.",pocket say glad hope sorry add son smile alarming personage young look man spite perplexity grey hair manner natural use word natural sense unaffected comic distraught way downright ludicrous perception near talk little say pocket anxious contraction eyebrow black handsome belinda hope welcome pip look book say yes smile absent state mind ask like taste orange flower water question bearing near remote foregone subsequent transaction consider throw like previous approach general conversational condescension
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.  Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased  Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased  father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s determined  opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, if  I ever knew,—the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s, the Lord  Chancellor’s, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s, anybody’s,—and had tacked  himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite  supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for  storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate  address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first  stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage  either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed  Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature  of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the  acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.",find hour mention pocket daughter certain accidental deceased knight invent conviction deceased father baronet somebody determine opposition arise entirely personal forget sovereign prime minister lord chancellor archbishop canterbury tack noble earth right supposititious fact believe knight storm english grammar point pen desperate address engross vellum occasion laying stone building hand royal personage trowel mortar direct pocket bring cradle nature thing marry title guard acquisition plebeian domestic knowledge
Dickens,Great Expectations,"So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady  by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but  perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,  in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was  also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to  mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing  the one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket  had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it  would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the  knowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing  to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that  dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket  that his wife was “a treasure for a Prince.” Mr. Pocket had invested  the Prince’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was  supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.  Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,  because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of  a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.",successful watch ward establish young lady judicious parent grow highly ornamental perfectly helpless useless character happily form bloom youth encounter pocket bloom youth decide mount woolsack roof mitre mere question time pocket take time forelock judge length want cutting marry knowledge judicious parent judicious parent have bestow withhold blessing handsomely settle dow short struggle inform pocket wife treasure prince pocket invest prince treasure way world suppose bring indifferent interest pocket general object queer sort respectful pity marry title pocket object queer sort forgiving reproach get
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a  pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for  my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other  similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle  and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of  architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,  was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of  exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.",pocket take house show room pleasant furnish use comfort private sitting room knock door similar room introduce occupant drummle startop drummle old looking young man heavy order architecture whistle startop young year appearance read hold head think danger explode strong charge knowledge
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody  else’s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house  and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the  servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of  saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the  servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their  eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They  allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always  appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded  in would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable of  self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady  with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that  she had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.  Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it  was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn’t mind their own  business.",pocket noticeable air somebody hand wonder possession house let live find unknown power servant smooth way go respect save trouble appearance expensive servant feel duty owe nice eating drinking deal company downstairs allow liberal table pocket appear far good house board suppose boarder capable self defence week neighbouring lady family personally unacquainted write see miller slap baby greatly distress pocket burst tear receive note say extraordinary thing neighbour mind business
Dickens,Great Expectations,"By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been  educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished  himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket  very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the  calling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whom  it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always  going to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the  blades had left the Grindstone,—he had wearied of that poor work and  had come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he  had “read” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,  and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned  his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,  and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still  maintained the house I saw.",degree learn chiefly herbert pocket educate harrow cambridge distinguish happiness marry pocket early life impair prospect take calling grinder grind number dull remarkable father influential go help preferment forget blade leave weary poor work come london gradually fail lofty hope read diver lack opportunity neglect refurbish diver special occasion turn acquirement account literary compilation correction mean add moderate private resource maintain house see
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highly  sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,  and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.  This lady’s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her  down to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand  on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.  Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read  with him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and  confidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five  minutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.",pocket toady neighbour widow lady highly sympathetic nature agree everybody bless everybody shed smile tear everybody accord circumstance lady coiler honour take dinner day installation give understand stair blow dear pocket dear pocket necessity receive gentleman read extend tell gush love confidence time know minute like thing

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and  Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and  other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian  name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It  further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the  garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which  her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at  all. Drummle didn’t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a  sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.  Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler  the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the  conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but  it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the  announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook  had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first  time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance  that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on  anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He  laid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at the  moment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make  an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done  this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with  what he was about.",come knowledge pass pocket drummle attentive knife fork spoon glass instrument self destruction drummle christian bentley actually heir baronetcy appear book see pocket reading garden title know exact date grandpapa come book come drummle limited way strike sulky kind fellow speak elect recognise pocket woman sister coiler toady neighbour show interest conversation appear painful herbert promise long time page come announcement domestic affliction effect cook mislay beef unutterable amazement time see pocket relieve mind go performance strike extraordinary impression anybody soon familiar rest lay carving knife engage carving hand disturbed hair appear extraordinary effort lift lift quietly go
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked  it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the  pleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at me  when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and  localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and  when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little  to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for  being on the opposite side of the table.",coiler change subject begin flatter like moment flatter grossly pleasure soon serpentine way come close pretend vitally interested friend locality leave altogether snaky fork tongue occasional bounce startop say little drummle say envy opposite table
Dickens,Great Expectations,"After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made  admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way of  improving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little  boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s next  successor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and  Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been  recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.  Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she  rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but  didn’t quite know what to make of them.",dinner child introduce coiler admire comment eye nose sagacious way improve mind little girl little boy baby baby successor bring flopson miller non commission officer recruit child enlist pocket look young nobles ought think pleasure inspect know

At length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,  softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the  dangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the  same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—",uneasy mind pocket fall discussion drummle respect baronetcy eat slice orange steep sugar wine forget baby lap appalling thing nut cracker length little jane perceive young brain imperille softly leave place small artifice coax dangerous weapon away pocket finish orange time approve say jane

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. It  doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited a  pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its  soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It happened that the other five children were left behind at the  dinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement, and  their not being anybody else’s business. I thus became aware of the  mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in  the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his  face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,  as if he couldn’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in  that establishment, and why they hadn’t been billeted by Nature on  somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain  questions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,  Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fanny  came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it  when she didn’t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and  gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as  they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the  hair he dismissed the hopeless subject.",happen child leave dinner table flopson have private engagement anybody business aware mutual relation pocket exemplify follow manner pocket normal perplexity face heighten hair rumple look minute come boarding lodge establishment billet nature somebody distant missionary way ask certain little joe hole frill say pa flopson go mend little fanny come whitlow say pa millers go poultice forget melt parental tenderness give shilling apiece tell play go strong effort lift hair dismiss hopeless subject
Dickens,Great Expectations,"In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop  had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I  was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but  as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to  say for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under the  tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to  whom I was introduced by my new allies.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and  had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had  ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk  together. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he  referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed  for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my  destiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young men in  prosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to  the contrary.",day establish room go backwards forward london time order want tradesman pocket long talk know intend career know refer have tell jaggers design profession educate destiny hold average young man prosperous circumstance acquiesce course know contrary

He hoped that  with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,  and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his  way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself  on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state  at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his  compact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling  mine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no  doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no  such excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever  regard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but what  was serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me.",advise attend certain place london acquisition mere rudiment want invest function explainer director study hope intelligent assistance meet little discourage soon able dispense aid way say similar purpose place confidential term admirable manner state zealous honourable fulfil compact zealous honourable fulfil show indifference master doubt return compliment pupil give excuse justice regard have ludicrous honest good tutor communication

Mr. Pocket did  not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could  possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt  that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would  save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted  my wish to Mr. Jaggers.",point settle far carry begin work earnest occur retain bedroom barnard inn life agreeably varied manner bad herbert society pocket object arrangement urge step possibly take submit guardian feel delicacy arise consideration plan save herbert expense go little britain imparted wish jaggers

When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the  post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of  which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his  coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark  and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.  Jaggers’s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase  for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something  between a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollen  man—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby  appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to  be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’s coffers. “Getting evidence  together,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.” In the  room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair  (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was  similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented  to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt  me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,  as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a  high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was  dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been  waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of  the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use.",accept offer wemmick biscuit post pay money cash box safe key safe keep produce coat collar like iron pigtail go upstairs house dark shabby greasy shoulder leave mark jagger room shuffle staircase year floor clerk look publican rat catcher large pale puff swollen man attentively engage people shabby appearance treat unceremoniously everybody treat contribute jaggers coffer get evidence say wemmick come bailey room little flabby terrier clerk dangling hair cropping forget puppy similarly engage man weak eye wemmick present smelter keep pot boil melt excessive white perspiration try art room high shoulder man face ache tie dirty flannel dress old black clothe bear appearance have wax stoop work make fair copy note gentleman jaggers use

If anybody, of whatsoever  degree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required to  have it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,  “I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,  “Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of  his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his  words, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their  direction. Which side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed to  me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I  stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was  making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive  under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the  representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.",reason clearly know jaggers find reply affirmative dive city come crowded police court blood relation murderous sense deceased fanciful taste brooch stand bar uncomfortably chew guardian woman examination cross know strike bench everybody present awe anybody whatsoever degree say word approve instantly require take anybody admission say anybody admission say get magistrate shiver single bite finger thief thief taker hang dread rapture word shrink hair eyebrow turn direction grind place mill know steal tiptoe bench make leg old gentleman preside convulsive table denunciation conduct representative british law justice chair day
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book  as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an  acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and  comprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the  large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he  himself lolled about in a room,—he was idle, proud, niggardly,  reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,  who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the  discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead.

He had a woman’s delicacy of feature, and  was—“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said Herbert to  me—“exactly like his mother.” It was but natural that I should take to  him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest  evenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one  another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in  our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He  would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious  creature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and  I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the  back-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the  moonlight in mid-stream.",startop spoil weak mother keep home ought school devotedly attach admire measure woman delicacy feature see say herbert like mother natural kindly drummle early evening boat pull homeward abreast converse boat boat bentley drummle come wake overhang bank rush creep shore like uncomfortable amphibious creature tide send fast way think come dark water boat break sunset moonlight mid stream

Georgiana, whom I  had seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also turned up. She  was a cousin,—an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity  religion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of  cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me  in my prosperity with the basest meanness.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied  myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began  to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should  have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my  books. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to  feel my deficiencies.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write  him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs under the  desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I’ll tell you  what I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,—which  is of home preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from the  cook’s-shop. I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop was a  Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.  I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out a  good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box  another day or two, we could easily have done it.” He said to that,  “Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.” I let him, of  course.

Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower  was raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which  might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he  had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill  going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent  that it made the back of your hand quite wet.",conduct bower dozen yard approach ingenious twist path take long time retreat glass set forth punch cool ornamental lake margin bower raise piece water island middle salad supper circular form construct fountain set little mill go take cork pipe play powerful extent hand wet

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,  with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great  nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the  moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and  repair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the  Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a  cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup  in it ring. Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown out  of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly,  “He’s fired! I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until it  is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.",proceed castle find aged heating poker expectant eye preliminary performance great nightly ceremony wemmick stand watch hand moment come red hot poker aged repair battery take go presently stinger go bang shake crazy little box cottage fall piece glass teacup ring age believe blow arm chair hold elbow cry exultingly fire heerd nod old gentleman figure speech declare absolutely
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me  his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious  character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been  committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and  several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon which  Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “every  one of ’em Lies, sir.” These were agreeably dispersed among small  specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the  proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.  They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had  been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general  sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan  on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the  suspension of a roasting-jack.",interval time supper wemmick devoted show collection curiosity felonious character comprise pen celebrate forgery commit distinguished razor lock hair manuscript confession write wemmick set particular value use word lies sir agreeably disperse small specimen china glass neat trifle proprietor museum tobacco stopper carve aged display chamber castle induct serve general sitting room kitchen judge saucepan hob brazen bijou fireplace design suspension roasting jack
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged  in the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered  to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper  was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot  insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have  been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.  Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there  being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when  I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that  pole on my forehead all night.",neat little girl attendance look age day lay supper cloth bridge lower mean egress withdraw night supper excellent castle subject dry rot insomuch taste like bad nut pig far heartily pleased entertainment drawback little turret bedroom thin ceiling flagstaff lie bed balance pole forehead night
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him  cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from  my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a  most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at  half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,  Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened  into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business  and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as  unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the  drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,  had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the  Stinger.",wemmick early morning afraid hear clean boot fall gardening see gothic window pretend employ aged nod devoted manner breakfast good supper half past precisely start little britain degree wemmick get dryer hard go mouth tighten post office get place business pull key coat collar look unconscious walworth property castle drawbridge arbour lake fountain aged blow space discharge stinger
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early  opportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of his  cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with  his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he  called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends  which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. “No ceremony,” he stipulated,  “and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.” I asked him where we should  come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his  general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,  “Come here, and I’ll take you home with me.” I embrace this opportunity  of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or  a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,  which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer’s shop. It had an  unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would  wash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,  whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his  room. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, he  seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than  usual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only  washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And  even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,  he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before  he put his coat on.",fall wemmick tell early opportunity compare guardian establishment cashier clerk guardian room wash hand scented soap go office walworth call give invitation friend wemmick prepare receive ceremony stipulate dinner dress morrow ask come idea live believe general objection like admission reply come home embrace opportunity remark wash client surgeon dentist closet room fit purpose smell scented soap like perfumer shop unusually large jack towel roller inside door wash hand wipe dry towel come police court dismiss client room friend repair day engage case dark complexion usual find head butt closet wash hand lave face gargle throat go round jack towel take penknife scrape case nail coat
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into  the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was  something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his  presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along  westward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of  the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he  never otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody  recognised him.",people slink usual pass street evidently anxious speak conclusive halo scented soap encircle presence give day walk westward recognise face crowd street happen talk louder recognise anybody take notice anybody recognise
Dickens,Great Expectations,"He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side  of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in  want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and  opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and  little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark  brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the  panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know  what kind of loops I thought they looked like.",conduct gerrard street soho house south street stately house kind dolefully want painting dirty window take key open door go stone hall bare gloomy little dark brown staircase series dark brown room floor carve garland panel wall stand give welcome know kind loop think look like
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his  dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the  whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was  comfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side of  his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and  decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed  throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed  everything himself.",dinner lay good room second dressing room bedroom tell hold house rarely see table comfortably lay silver service course chair capacious dumb waiter variety bottle decanter dish fruit dessert notice keep hand distribute
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,  that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,  trials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very  solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,  and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a  little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring  the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an  evening and fall to work.",bookcase room see back book evidence criminal law criminal biography trial act parliament thing furniture solid good like watch chain official look merely ornamental see corner little table paper shaded lamp bring office home respect wheel evening fall work
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had  walked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,  and took a searching look at them.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought her  younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely  pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot  say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be  parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious  expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see  Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked  to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had  seen rise out of the Witches’ caldron.",woman think young tall lithe nimble figure extremely pale large faded eye quantity stream hair diseased affection heart cause lip part pant face bear curious expression suddenness flutter know macbeth theatre night face look disturb fiery air like face see rise witches caldron
Dickens,Great Expectations,"She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a  finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats  at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,  while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the  housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice  mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all  the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our  host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the  table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean  plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just  disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant  than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw  in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made  a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other  natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass  behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.",set dish touch guardian quietly arm finger notify dinner ready vanish take seat round table guardian keep drummle startop sit noble dish fish housekeeper table joint equally choice mutton equally choice bird sauce wine accessory want good give host dumb waiter circuit table similarly deal clean plate knife fork course drop disuse basket ground chair attendant housekeeper appear set dish see face face rise caldron year dreadful likeness woman cause face natural resemblance derive flow hair pass bowl flame spirit dark room
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own  striking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed that  whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my  guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put  before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and  wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I  fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and  a purpose of always holding her in suspense.",induce particular notice housekeeper strike appearance wemmick preparation observe room keep eye attentively guardian remove hand dish hesitatingly dread call want speak nigh fancy detect manner consciousness purpose hold suspense
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather  than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of  our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing  my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to  boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my  lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the  development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious  way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.",dinner go gayly guardian follow originate subject know wrench weak disposition find express tendency lavish expenditure patronise herbert boast great prospect know open lip drummle development inclination gird grudging suspicious way rest screw fish take
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our  conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied  for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.  Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to  our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that  as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible  agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity  about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show  how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in  a ridiculous manner.",get cheese conversation turn rowing feat drummle rally come night slow amphibious way drummle inform host prefer room company skill master strength scatter like chaff invisible agency guardian wind pitch little short ferocity trifle fall bare span arm muscular fall bare span arm ridiculous manner
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,  taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,  was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and  showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.  Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s, like a trap,  as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do  this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.",housekeeper time clear table guardian take heed face turn lean chair bite forefinger show interest drummle inexplicable suddenly clap large hand housekeeper like trap stretch table suddenly smartly stop foolish contention

Dickens,Great Expectations,"He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She  brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by  side. The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred  across and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from  Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us  in succession.",take hand turn wrist table bring hand hold wrist scarred scarred hold hand take eye jaggers turn watchfully rest succession

The moment  he ceased, she looked at him again. “That’ll do, Molly,” said Mr.  Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.”  She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,  putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and  passed round the wine.",say word leisurely critical style continue look regular succession sit moment cease look molly say jagger give slight nod admire withdraw hand go room jaggers put decanter dumb waiter fill glass pass round wine

Dickens,Great Expectations,"If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,  it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose  depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,  until he became downright intolerable.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,  and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some  boorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were too free with  our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that  it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my  presence but a week or so before.",boyish want discretion dare take drink know talk particularly hot boorish sneer drummle effect free money lead remarking zeal discretion come bad grace startop lend money presence week

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than  I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,  being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact  opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct  personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop  tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made  us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,  Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his  pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and  would have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for our entertainer’s  dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that  purpose.",startop take hand well grace show exhort little agreeable startop lively bright young fellow drummle exact opposite disposed resent direct personal affront retort coarse lumpish way startop try turn discussion aside small pleasantry laugh resent little success drummle threat warning pull hand pocket drop round shoulder swore take large glass fling adversary head entertainer dexterously seize instant raise purpose

Dickens,Great Expectations,"On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,  Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing had  happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not  even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,  who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;  Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the  houses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.",hint rise depart get street door startop cheerily call drummle old boy happen old boy far respond walk hammersmith way herbert remain town see go street opposite side startop lead drummle lag shadow house wo nt follow boat

If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly  would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming  to Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall  in Bentley Drummle’s way. I had little objection to his being seen by  Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the  sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in  contempt.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite  unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those  wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly  different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour of  occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring  upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a  boy in boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might have  been said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of  the refuse of my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a blue  coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots  already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to  eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my  existence.",begin decorate chamber unnecessary inappropriate way expensive wrestle barnard prove time room vastly different find enjoy honour occupy prominent page book neighbouring upholsterer get fast late start boy bondage slavery say pass day monster refuse washerwoman family clothe blue coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breech boot mention find little great deal eat horrible requirement haunt existence

I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming  upstairs,—his state boots being always too big for him,—and by the time  it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his  ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his  finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards  distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a  faint single rap, and Pepper—such was the compromising name of the  avenging boy—announced “Mr. Gargery!” I thought he never would have  done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the  mat, but at last he came in.",time approach like run away avenger pursuant order hall presently hear joe staircase know joe clumsy manner come state boot big time take read name floor course ascent stop outside door hear finger trace paint letter distinctly hear breathe keyhole finally give faint single rap pepper compromise avenging boy announce gargery think wipe foot go lift mat come

Indeed, it demanded from him a constant  attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by  wicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the  greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it  dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring  it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern  of the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;  finally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of  laying hands upon it.",believe joe prolong word mightily expressive mind architecture know perfect chorus attention providentially attract hat topple demand constant attention quickness eye hand like exact wicket keeping extraordinary play show great skill rush catch neatly drop merely stop midway beat humour part room good deal pattern paper wall feel safe close finally splash slop basin take liberty lay hand

Why should a man scrape himself  to that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why  should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his  holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of  meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had  his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such  remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more  than he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t dropped it; that I was  heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.",shirt collar coat collar perplex reflect mystery man scrape extent consider dressed suppose necessary purify suffer holiday clothe fall unaccountable fit meditation fork midway plate mouth eye attract strange direction afflict remarkable cough sit far table drop eat pretend drop heartily glad herbert leave city

But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow’s coach, and had been  down to Mr. Pocket’s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the  last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up  at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe’s; I was not  expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss  Havisham’s, and she was exacting and mightn’t like it. All other  swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such  pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should  innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else’s manufacture is  reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin  of my own make as good money!

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much  disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was  tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots  in the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to  imagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop, and confounding the  disrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy. On the other hand, Trabb’s boy  might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless  and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High  Street.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as  winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until  two or three hours after dark.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards  by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside  passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling  their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised  when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were  two convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old  reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word  “convict.”",time customary carry convict dock yard stage coach hear capacity outside passenger see high road dangle iron leg coach roof cause surprise herbert meet yard come tell convict go reason old reason constitutionally falter hear word convict

Dickens,Great Expectations,"They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler  with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.  The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their  legs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I  likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a  thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good  understanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at  the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts  were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he  the Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and  appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the  world, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller  suit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those  shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his  half-closed eye at one glance.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had  never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye  appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said  something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves  round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something  else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;  their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower  animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with  pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them  and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable  and degraded spectacle.",easy sure know see life look eye appraise watch chain incidentally spit say convict laugh slue round clink coupling manacle look great number back street door coarse mangy ungainly outer surface low animal iron leg apologetically garland pocket handkerchief way present look keep herbert say disagreeable degraded spectacle
Dickens,Great Expectations,"But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the  back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and  that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in  front behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had  taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,  and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such  villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and  infamous, and shameful, and I don’t know what else. At this time the  coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing  to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringing  with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and  hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.",bad come coach take family remove london place prisoner seat coachman choleric gentleman take fourth place seat fly violent passion say breach contract mix villainous company poisonous pernicious infamous shameful know time coach ready coachman impatient prepare prisoner come curious flavour bread poultice baize rope yarn hearthstone attend convict presence

Dickens,Great Expectations,"After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and  been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling  certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not  only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and  so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could  have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our  being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a  dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in  his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as  soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This  device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot  under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down  before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the  first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their  way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off  to the river.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could  not fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for  me to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark  rooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down  the cobwebs, destroy the vermin,—in short, do all the shining deeds of  the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to  look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked  windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with  its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich  attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the  inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had  taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so  set upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had  been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her  with any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this  place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be  followed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the  conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified  truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her  simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my  sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against  reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against  happiness, against all discouragement that could be.

Certain keys were  hanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his  patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"What _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and  looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?  No. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of  resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been  acquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much  associated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will  produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces  that are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to  Miss Havisham.

We had stopped near the centre  of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms  stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow  cloth.

When I saw him in the room he  had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking  at us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent  pause in that attitude, “Indeed?

We dined very well, and were waited on by a  maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but  who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole  time.

He kept his very looks to  himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once during  dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,  but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often  looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his  face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a  dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often  referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,  he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he  extorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those references  out of my innocent self.",equal determined reticence jaggers roof see keep look scarcely direct eye estella face dinner speak listen course answer look hand look interest curiosity distrust face show consciousness dinner take dry delight make sarah pocket greener yellower refer conversation expectation show consciousness appear extort extort know reference innocent self

He cross-examined his very wine when he had  nothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted  the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass  again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and  cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had  known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or  four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he  saw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his  hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to  take notice that it was of no use, for he couldn’t answer.",leave sit air general lie consequence information possess cros examine wine hand hold candle taste port roll mouth swallow look glass smell port try drank fill cross examine glass nervous know wine tell disadvantage time feebly think start conversation see go ask look glass hand roll wine mouth request notice use answer
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in  the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her  cap,—which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,—and  strewing the ground with her hair,—which assuredly had never grown on  _her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss  Havisham’s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss  Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels  from her dressing-table into Estella’s hair, and about her bosom and  arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick  eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,  with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.",think miss pocket conscious sight involve danger goad madness tear hideous nature muslin strew ground assuredly grow head appear go miss havisham room play whist interval miss havisham fantastic way beautiful jewel dressing table estella hair bosom arm see guardian look thick eyebrow raise little loveliness rich flush glitter colour

What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his  cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I  could never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never  bear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear  to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be  within a foot or two of him,—it was, that my feelings should be in the  same place with him,—_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.",manner extent take trump custody come mean little card end hand glory king queens utterly abase feeling respect look personally light obvious poor riddle find long ago suffer incompatibility cold presence feeling estella know bear speak know bear hear creak boot know bear wash hand admiration foot feeling place agonizing circumstance

I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my  pillow, “I love her, I love her, I love her!” hundreds of times. Then,  a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,  once the blacksmith’s boy.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar  in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick’s  being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham’s.  “Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,” said my guardian,  comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, “because the man  who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.” It seemed  quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not  exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a  satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. “Very  good, Pip,” he observed, when I had concluded, “I’ll go round  presently, and pay our friend off.” Rather alarmed by this summary  action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend  himself might be difficult to deal with. “Oh no he won’t,” said my  guardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect  confidence; “I should like to see him argue the question with _me_.”",consider matter dress blue boar morning resolve tell guardian doubt orlick right sort man fill post trust miss havisham course right sort man pip say guardian comfortably satisfied general head man fill post trust right sort man spirit find particular post exceptionally hold right sort man listen satisfied manner tell knowledge orlick good pip observe conclude round presently pay friend alarm summary action little delay hint friend difficult deal oh wo say guardian make pocket handkerchief point perfect confidence like argue question
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I  breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely  hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a  walk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers  was occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into  my place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar  immediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of  miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook’s premises, I  got round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and  felt myself in comparative security.",go london midday coach breakfast terror pumblechook scarcely hold cup give opportunity say want walk london road jaggers occupy let coachman know place overtaken enable fly blue boar immediately breakfast make loop couple mile open country pumblechook premise get round high street little pitfall feel comparative security

One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops  and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,  as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,—on which  occasions I don’t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they  of not doing it, or I of not seeing it.

Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best  beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced  with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating  myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb’s boy smote  together, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in  every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,  “Hold me! I’m so frightened!” feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and  contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance.

I had not advanced  another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,  and indignation, I again beheld Trabb’s boy approaching. He was coming  round a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest  industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s with  cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became  aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his  motion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees  more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His  sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,  and I felt utterly confounded.",hard thing bear advance yard inexpressible terror amazement indignation behold trabb boy approach come round narrow corner blue bag sling shoulder honest industry beam eye determination proceed trabb cheerful briskness indicate gait shock aware severely visit time motion rotatory stagger round round knee afflict uplifted hand beseech mercy suffering hail great joy knot spectator feel utterly confound
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when  I again beheld Trabb’s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he  was entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my  great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the  opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young  friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his  hand, “Don’t know yah!” Words cannot state the amount of aggravation  and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy, when passing abreast of me,  he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm  akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,  and drawling to his attendants, “Don’t know yah, don’t know yah, ’pon  my soul don’t know yah!” The disgrace attendant on his immediately  afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with  crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was  a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and  was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.",get street post office behold trabb boy shoot round way time entirely change wear blue bag manner great coat strut pavement opposite street attend company delighted young friend time time exclaim wave hand know yah word state aggravation injury wreak trabb boy pass abreast pull shirt collar twine hair stick arm akimbo smirk extravagantly wriggle elbow body drawl attendant know yah know yah pon soul know yah disgrace attendant immediately take crow pursue bridge crow exceedingly deject fowl know blacksmith culminate disgrace leave town speak eject open country

To have  struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower  recompense from him than his heart’s best blood, would have been futile  and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an  invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew  out again between his captor’s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,  however, to Mr. Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr. Pip must  decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed  to the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited  Loathing in every respectable mind.",take life trabb boy occasion save endure struggle street exact low recompense heart good blood futile degrading boy man hurt invulnerable dodge serpent chase corner fly captor leg scornfully yelping write trabb day post pip decline deal far forget owe good interest society employ boy excite loathing respectable mind

Dickens,Great Expectations,"“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, “it seems to  me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into  our gift-horse’s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to  me that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether  overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn’t you tell me that  your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were  not endowed with expectations only?

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country  elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The  whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble  boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer  with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in  life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of  white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My  gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could  have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.",arrival denmark find king queen country elevate arm chair kitchen table hold court danish nobility attendance consist noble boy wash leather boot gigantic ancestor venerable peer dirty face rise people late life danish chivalry comb hair pair white silk leg present feminine appearance gifted townsman stand gloomily apart fold arm wish curl forehead probable
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action  proceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been  troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it  with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom  also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had  the appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of  anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were  suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led  to the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—a  recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted  of this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of  having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it  perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its  terrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom  lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public  to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem  by a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her  waist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so  that she was openly mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble boy in  the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were  in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a  clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court  fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice  discrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a  want of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holy  orders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general  indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such  slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off  her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who  had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the  front row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s  have supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.",curious little circumstance transpire action proceed late king country appear trouble cough time decease take tomb bring royal phantom carry ghostly manuscript round truncheon appearance occasionally refer air anxiety tendency lose place reference suggestive state mortality conceive lead shade advise gallery turn recommendation take extremely ill likewise note majestic spirit appear air have long time walk immense distance perceptibly come closely contiguous wall occasion terror receive derisively queen denmark buxom lady doubt historically brazen consider public brass chin attach diadem broad band metal gorgeous toothache waist encircle arm openly mention kettle drum noble boy ancestral boot inconsistent represent breath able seaman stroll actor grave digger clergyman person utmost importance court fencing match authority practise eye nice discrimination fine stroke judge gradually lead want toleration detect holy order decline perform funeral service general indignation take form nut lastly ophelia prey slow musical madness course time take white muslin scarf fold bury sulky man long cool impatient nose iron bar row gallery growl baby bed let supper keeping
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with  playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or  state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on  the question whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared  yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said “Toss up for  it;” and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such  fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged  with loud cries of “Hear, hear!” When he appeared with his stocking  disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very  neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat  iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness  of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had  given him. On his taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute  that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the  door,—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he  recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,  “And don’t _you_ do it, neither; you’re a deal worse than _him_!” And I  grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of  these occasions.",unfortunate townsman incident accumulate playful effect undecided prince ask question state doubt public help example question twa nobler mind suffer roar yes incline opinion say toss debating society arise ask fellow crawl earth heaven encourage loud cry hear hear appear stocking disorder disorder express accord usage neat fold suppose get flat iron conversation take place gallery respect paleness leg occasion turn ghost give take like little black flute play orchestra hand call unanimously rule britannia recommend player saw air sulky man say deal bad grieve add peal laughter greet wopsle occasion
Dickens,Great Expectations,"But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the  appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical  wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in  a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,  the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out! Here’s the  undertaker a coming, to see how you’re a getting on with your work!” I  believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle  could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,  without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;  but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without  the comment, “Wai-ter!” The arrival of the body for interment (in an  empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a  general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the  bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended  Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the  orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the  king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles  upward.",great trial churchyard appearance primeval forest kind small ecclesiastical wash house turnpike gate wopsle comprehensive black cloak descry enter turnpike gravedigger admonish friendly way look undertaker coming getting work believe know constitutional country wopsle possibly return skull moralize dust finger white napkin take breast innocent indispensable action pass comment wai ter arrival body interment black box lid tumble open signal general joy enhance discovery bearer individual obnoxious identification joy attend wopsle struggle laerte brink orchestra grave slacken tumble king kitchen table die inch ankle upward
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;  but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,  feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I  laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;  and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly  fine in Mr. Wopsle’s elocution,—not for old associations’ sake, I am  afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and  downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural  circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.  When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I  said to Herbert, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.”",pale effort beginning applaud wopsle hopeless persist sit feel keenly laugh ear ear laugh spite time thing droll latent impression decidedly fine wopsle old association sake afraid slow dreary uphill downhill unlike way man natural circumstance life death express tragedy call hoot say herbert let shall meet

Herbert said he thought it would be kind  to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard’s with us,  wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until  two o’clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his  plans.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge  where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison  rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much  neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all  public wrongdoing—and which is always its heaviest and longest  punishment—was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better  than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their  prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their  soup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was  going his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,  were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,  disorderly, depressing scene it was.",newgate minute pass lodge fetter hang bare wall prison rule interior jail time jail neglect period exaggerated reaction consequent public wrongdoing heavy longest punishment far felon lodge feed well soldier pauper seldom set fire prison excusable object improve flavour soup visit time wemmick take potman go round beer prisoner bar yard buy beer talk friend frowzy ugly disorderly depressing scene
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener  might walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his  seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, “What,  Captain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that Black  Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn’t look for you these two months;  how do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at the bars and  attending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with his  post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,  as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,  since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.",strike wemmick walk prisoner gardener walk plant head see shoot come night say captain tom ah black bill cistern look month find equally stopping bar attend anxious post office immovable state look conference take particular notice advance observe come blow trial
Dickens,Great Expectations,"He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department  of Mr. Jaggers’s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers  hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His  personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,  and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both  hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in  his pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting  the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible  from the insufficient money produced, said, “it’s no use, my boy. I’m  only a subordinate. I can’t take it. Don’t go on in that way with a  subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had  better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals  in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,  may be worth the while of another; that’s my recommendation to you,  speaking as a subordinate.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see  now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a  peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that  went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of  the bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fatty  surface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose military  salute.",soon speak portly upright man write wear olive colour frock coat peculiar pallor overspread red complexion eye go wander try fix come corner bar hand hat greasy fatty surface like cold broth half half jocose military salute

Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are  portable property all the same.” With that, he looked back, and nodded  at this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of  the yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its  place.",right say wemmick shall take care good afternoon colonel good bye shake hand walk away wemmick say coiner good workman recorder report day sure execute monday far go pair pigeon portable property look nod dead plant cast eye walk yard consider pot well place
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great  importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than  by those whom they held in charge. “Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said the  turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,  and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what’s Mr.  Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder?

Dickens,Great Expectations,"“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm  to be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better  thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He’s always so  high. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.  That Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durst  ask him his intentions respecting a case.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where  suppliants for Mr. Jaggers’s notice were lingering about as usual, and  I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some  three hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange  it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and  crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter  evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have  reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded  but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and  advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful  young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with  absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished  that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone  with him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not  have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust  off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress,  and I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel,  remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and  I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick’s  conservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand  waving to me.",wemmick part office little britain suppliant jaggers notice linger usual return watch street coach office hour hand consume time think strange encompass taint prison crime childhood lonely marsh winter evening encounter reappear occasion start like stain fade go new way pervade fortune advancement mind engage think beautiful young estella proud refined come think absolute abhorrence contrast jail wish wemmick meet yield go day year day newgate breath clothe beat prison dust foot saunter fro shake dress exhale air lung contaminate feel remember come coach come quickly free soil consciousness wemmick conservatory see face coach window hand wave

Dickens,Great Expectations,"She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a  waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen  such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,  he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he  couldn’t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the  establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous  article, considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,  and somebody’s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us  into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a  scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked  at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;  which, proving to be merely, “Some tea for the lady,” sent him out of  the room in a very low state of mind.",draw arm request waiter stare coach like man see thing life private sitting room pull napkin magic clue find way upstairs lead black hole establishment fit diminish mirror superfluous article consider hole proportion anchovy sauce cruet somebody pattens objecting retreat take room dinner table thirty grate scorch leaf copy book bushel coal dust have look extinct conflagration shake head take order prove merely tea lady send room low state mind
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong  combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that  the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising  proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.

The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she  gave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed  likewise.

But  Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of  the baby’s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him  quiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot  Guards) of Millers.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to  notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on  my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,  but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of  chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was  not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the  night,—like Camilla,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,  that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss  Havisham’s face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with  Joe in the honest old forge.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of  mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part  in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,  and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my  satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the  influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so  I perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial to  anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My  lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not  afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace  with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having  unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor  arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,  and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them  slumbering. But Herbert’s was a very different case, and it often  caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in  crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery  work, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.",estella inseparable restlessness disquiet mind fall confusion limit production suppose expectation estella think satisfaction well concern influence position difficulty perceive dimly beneficial anybody beneficial herbert lavish habit lead easy nature expense afford corrupt simplicity life disturb peace anxiety regret remorseful have unwittingly set branch pocket family poor art practise littleness natural bent evoke anybody leave slumbering herbert different case cause twinge think evil service crowd sparely furnish chamber incongruous upholstery work place canary breast avenger disposal
Dickens,Great Expectations,"So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began  to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must  begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop’s suggestion, we put  ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the  Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were  not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to  quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause  six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying  social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I  understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast  of the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good  feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”",infallible way make little ease great ease begin contract quantity debt hardly begin herbert begin soon follow startop suggestion election club call finches grove object institution divine member dine expensively fortnight quarrel possible dinner cause waiter drunk stair know gratifying social end invariably accomplish herbert understand refer standing toast society run gentleman present promotion good feel reign predominant finches grove
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in  Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of  joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about  town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts  at the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his  equipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion  deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—like  coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could  not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of  age.",finches spend money foolishly hotel dine covent garden finch see honour join grove bentley drummle time flounder town cab great deal damage post street corner occasionally shoot equipage headforemost apron see occasion deliver door grove unintentional way like coal anticipate little finch accord sacred law society come age
Dickens,Great Expectations,"In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken  Herbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make  no such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every  direction, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into  keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him  with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about  him more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into  dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather  clearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards  midnight; and that at about two o’clock in the morning, he became so  deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to  America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his  fortune.",confidence resource willingly take herbert expense herbert proud proposal get difficulty direction continue look gradually fall keep late hour late company notice look despond eye breakfast time begin look hopefully midday droop come dinner descry capital distance clearly dinner realise capital midnight morning deeply despondent talk buy rifle go america general purpose compelling buffalo fortune
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at  Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert  would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those  seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that  the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the  general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,  was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew  greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by  the hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,  read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about  her grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it  into bed whenever it attracted her notice.",usually hammersmith half week hammersmith haunt richmond whereof separately herbert come hammersmith think season father occasionally pass perception opening look appear general tumbling family tumbling life thing transact meantime pocket grow greyer try oftener lift perplexity hair pocket trip family footstool read book dignity lose pocket handkerchief tell grandpapa teach young idea shoot shoot bed attract notice

Dickens,Great Expectations,"We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people  could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less  miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.  There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying  ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my  belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.",spend money get little people mind miserable acquaintance condition gay fiction constantly enjoy skeleton truth good belief case aspect common
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look  about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he  consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an  almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I  ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we  undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a  Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except  at a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observance  of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything  else in connection with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come back  again. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively  must find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walk  in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the  assembled magnates. “For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on  one of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that  an opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”",morning air new herbert go city look pay visit dark room consort ink jar hat peg coal box string box almanac desk stool ruler remember see look undertake faithfully herbert live republic virtues poor fellow certain hour afternoon observance ceremony see principal think connection lloyd find come feel case unusually positively find opening change busy time walk kind gloomy country dance figure assembled magnate say herbert come home dinner special occasion find truth handel opening wo come
Dickens,Great Expectations,"If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated  one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond  expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight  of the Avenger’s livery; which had a more expensive and a less  remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the  four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast  became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at  breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not  unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,”  I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him  off his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a booted  Cupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.",attach think hate regularly morning detest chamber expression period repentance endure sight avenger livery expensive remunerative appearance time hour get debt breakfast hollower hollower form occasion breakfast time threaten letter legal proceeding unwholly unconnected local paper jewelery go far seize avenger blue collar shake actually air like booted presume suppose want roll

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the  reputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive,  energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities  down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My  self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.  When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,  docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical  bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not  my administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into  a focus for him.",think establish occasion reputation rate man decisive energetic clear cool head get responsibility list compare bill tick self approval tick entry luxurious sensation tick fold bill uniformly docket tie symmetrical bundle herbert modestly say administrative genius feel bring affair focus
Dickens,Great Expectations,"My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called  “leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be one  hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave a  margin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to be  four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven  hundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,  but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have  been an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,  to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of  freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another  margin.",business habit bright feature call leave margin example suppose herbert debt pound twopence leave margin suppose time leave margin seven high opinion wisdom margin bind acknowledge look deem expensive device run new debt immediately extent margin sense freedom solvency impart get pretty far margin

Dickens,Great Expectations,"We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we  might not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one  evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said  door, and fall on the ground. “It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert,  going out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing the  matter.” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.",shut outer door solemn occasion order interrupt fall serene state evening hear letter drop slit said door fall ground handel say herbert go come hope matter allusion heavy black seal border

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and  the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my  sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That  the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed  unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my  thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming  towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the  door. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,  there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of  the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she  were still alive and had been often there.",time grave open road life gap smooth ground wonderful figure sister chair kitchen fire haunt night day place possibly mind unable compass seldom thought late strange idea come street presently knock door room associate blankness death perpetual suggestion sound voice turn face figure alive

But I suppose there is a shock of regret  which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and  perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized  with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had  suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have  revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.",fortune scarcely recall sister tenderness suppose shock regret exist tenderness influence want soft feeling seize violent indignation assailant suffer feel sufficient proof revengefully pursue orlick extremity

Dickens,Great Expectations,"At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.  had put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally  absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a  black bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any  comfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them I  recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young  couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of  intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped  round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and  most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed  windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two  warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too  much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.",come sight house see trabb funereal execution take possession dismally absurd person ostentatiously exhibit crutch black instrument possibly communicate comfort post door recognise postboy discharge boar turn young couple sawpit bridal morning consequence intoxication render necessary ride horse clasp round neck arm child village woman admire sable warder closed window house forge come warder postboy knock far exhausted grief strength remain knock

Here, Mr.  Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves  up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity  of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished  putting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;  so he held out his hand for mine.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly  here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I  thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and  there began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.  The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I  looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible  until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum  cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and  biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had  never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.  Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook  in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately  stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my  attention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing  sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “May I, dear sir?” and  did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent  speechless paroxysm in a corner.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and  we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful  and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us  off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such  times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on  our emergence round some corner of expectancy, “_Here_ they come!”  “_Here_ they are!” and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was  much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted  all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,  and smoothing my cloak.

And there, my sister was  laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the  light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.",range marsh lie clear sail ship river grow go churchyard close grave unknown parent philip pirrip late parish georgiana wife sister lay quietly earth lark sing high light wind strew beautiful shadow cloud tree

When we got back, he had the  hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had  done her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it  reasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank  all the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two  talked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as  if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were  notoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.  Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly  Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest  benefactor.",conduct worldly minded pumblechook desire address noble passage read remind humanity bring world fleeth like shadow continueth long stay hear cough reservation case young gentleman come unexpectedly large property get hardihood tell wish sister know honour hint consider reasonably purchase price death drink rest sherry hubble drink port talk observe customary case race deceased notoriously immortal finally go away evening feel sure tell jolly bargemen founder fortune early benefactor

Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a  cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old  kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his  knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great  restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and  when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down  together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better.

He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than  Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to  dinner.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the  other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with  the greatest ease.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in  the post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or  three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed  of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both  before and behind, made her figure very like a boy’s kite; and I might  have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves  a little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of  fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in  discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our  going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for  announcing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a  moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently  another click came, and another little door tumbled open with “Miss  Skiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then  Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up  together. On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances,  I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he  said, “Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.  And by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the  people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known  to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”",miss skiffins wooden appearance like escort post office branch service year young wemmick judge stand possess portable property cut dress waist upward figure like boy kite pronounce gown little decidedly orange glove little intensely green good sort fellow show high regard aged long discover frequent visitor castle go compliment wemmick ingenious contrivance announce aged beg attention moment chimney disappear presently click come little door tumble open miss skiffin miss skiffins shut john tumble open miss skiffins john tumble open finally shut wemmick return work mechanical appliance express great admiration regard say know pleasant useful aged george sir thing worth mention people come gate secret pull know aged miss skiffins

Thinking that he  did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I  seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.",miss skiffins take bonnet retain green glove evening outward visible sign company wemmick invite walk round property island look wintertime think opportunity take walworth sentiment seize opportunity soon castle
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I  had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in  behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how  we had fought. I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his character, and  at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;  those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had  derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I  confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might  have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham  in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the  possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the  certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any  mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told  Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a  great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some  rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick’s experience  and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my  resources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred a  year, to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him on  to some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to  understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert’s  knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world  with whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his  shoulder, and saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know it  must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever  brought me here.”",have thought matter care approach subject hint inform wemmick anxious behalf herbert pocket tell meet fight glance herbert home character have means dependent father uncertain unpunctual allude advantage derive rawness ignorance society confess fear ill repay well expectation keep miss havisham background great distance hint possibility have compete prospect certainty possess generous soul far mean distrust retaliation design reason tell wemmick young companion friend great affection wish good fortune reflect ray seek advice wemmick experience knowledge man affair well try resource help herbert present year good hope gradually buy small partnership beg wemmick conclusion understand help render herbert knowledge suspicion world advise wound lay hand shoulder say help confide know troublesome fault have bring

Dickens,Great Expectations,"After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned  into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The  responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and  that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me  in some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were  going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a  hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as  it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss  Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises  became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to  participate in the entertainment.",little conversation effect return castle find miss skiffins prepare tea responsible duty make toast delegate aged excellent old gentleman intent danger melt eye nominal meal go vigorous reality aged prepare hay stack buttered toast scarcely simmer iron stand hook bar miss skiffin brew jorum tea pig premise strongly excited repeatedly express desire participate entertainment
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right  moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth  as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed  the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of  John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some  spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I  got used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss  Skiffins’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and  I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the  profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very  new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by  Wemmick.",flag strike gun fire right moment time feel snugly cut rest walworth moat thirty foot wide deep disturb tranquillity castle occasional tumbling open john miss skiffins little door prey spasmodic infirmity sympathetically uncomfortable get infer methodical nature miss skiffin arrangement tea sunday night suspect classic brooch wear represent profile undesirable female straight nose new moon piece portable property give wemmick
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was  delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged  especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage  tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in the  absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of  her family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling  lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on  her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now,  Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”",eat toast drank tea proportion delightful warm greasy get age especially pass clean old chief savage tribe oiled short pause repose miss skiffins absence little servant retire bosom family sunday afternoon wash tea thing trifling lady like amateur manner compromise glove draw round fire wemmick say aged parent tip paper
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that  this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman  infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. “I won’t offer an  apology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures—are  you, Aged P.?”",wemmick explain aged get spectacle accord custom give old gentleman infinite satisfaction read news aloud wo offer apology say wemmick capable pleasure aged

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’s  great-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come  through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was  always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into  them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was  equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,  quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all  expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he  resumed again.",aged reading remind class wopsle great aunt pleasanter peculiarity come keyhole want candle close verge put head newspaper require watching powder mill wemmick equally untiring gentle vigilance aged read unconscious rescue look express great interest amazement nod resume
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a  shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.  Wemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually  stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’s waist. In course of time I saw  his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment  Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm  again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest  deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins’s composure  while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever  seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction  of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it  mechanically.",wemmick miss skiffins sit sit shadowy corner observe slow gradual elongation wemmick mouth powerfully suggestive slowly gradually steal arm round miss skiffins waist course time see hand appear miss skiffins moment miss skiffins neatly stop green glove unwound arm article dress great deliberation lay table miss skiffins composure remarkable sight see think act consistent abstraction mind deem miss skiffins perform mechanically
Dickens,Great Expectations,"By and by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear again, and  gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to  widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite  enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side  of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness  of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid  it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am  justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged’s reading,  Wemmick’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled  to it by Miss Skiffins.",notice wemmick arm begin disappear gradually fade view shortly mouth begin widen interval suspense enthral painful see hand appear miss skiffins instantly miss skiffins stop neatness placid boxer take girdle cestus lay table take table represent path virtue justify state time aged reading wemmick arm stray path virtue recall miss skiffins
Dickens,Great Expectations,"At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time  for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black  bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical  dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these  appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who  was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and  Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer  to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had  best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and  having passed a pleasant evening.",aged read light slumber time wemmick produce little kettle tray glass black bottle porcelain top cork represent clerical dignitary rubicund social aspect aid appliance warm drink include aged soon awake miss skiffins mixed observe wemmick drink glass course know well offer miss skiffins home circumstance think good take cordial leave aged have pass pleasant evening
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,  stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter  appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would  be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to  Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by  appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication  with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that  we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long  established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted  capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a  partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which  Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds  down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at  certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my  property. Miss Skiffins’s brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick  pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.",week receive note wemmick date walworth state hope advance matter appertaining private personal capacity glad come go walworth see appointment city time hold communication subject near little britain upshot find worthy young merchant shipping broker long establish business want intelligent help want capital course time receipt want partner secret article sign herbert subject pay half pound engage sundry payment fall certain date income contingent come property miss skiffins brother conduct negotiation wemmick pervade appear
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the  least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the  radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a  mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the  young merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having shown an  extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the  opening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his  face brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate  friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of  triumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and  he having that day entered Clarriker’s House, and he having talked to  me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really  cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations  had done some good to somebody.",business cleverly manage herbert suspicion hand shall forget radiant face come home afternoon tell mighty piece news have fall clarriker young merchant clarriker have show extraordinary inclination belief opening come day day hope grow strong face bright think affectionate friend great difficulty restrain tear triumph see happy length thing have day enter clarriker house have talk evening flush pleasure success cry good earnest go bed think expectation good somebody

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a  widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother  looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s complexion was  pink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,  and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good  position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,  if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but  the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and  that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss  Havisham’s before the time of her seclusion.",lady estella place brandley widow daughter year old estella mother look young daughter look old mother complexion pink daughter yellow mother set frivolity daughter theology call good position visit visit number people little community feel subsist estella understanding establish necessary necessary brandley friend miss havisham time seclusion
Dickens,Great Expectations,"In Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I suffered  every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The  nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of  familiarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my  distraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned  the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a  constant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,  steward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger brother  of her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself further  from my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her  by her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the  circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely  that it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it  almost maddened me.",brandley house brandley house suffer kind degree torture estella cause nature relation place term familiarity place term favour conduce distraction use tease admirer turn familiarity account put constant slight devotion secretary steward half brother poor young brother appoint hope near privilege call hear circumstance aggravation trial think likely madden lover know certainly madden

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as will  presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habitually  reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced  upon us.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I  last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was  something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to  pry into my heart and probe its wounds. “How does she use you, Pip; how  does she use you?” she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,  even in Estella’s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at  night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella’s hand drawn  through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by  dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular  letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;  and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind  mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch  stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a  very spectre.",estella look search glance pry heart probe wound use pip use ask witch like eagerness estella hearing sit flickering fire night weird keep estella hand draw arm clutch hand extort dint refer estella tell regular letter name condition man fascinate miss havisham dwelt roll intensity mind mortally hurt diseased sit hand crutch stick chin wan bright eye glare spectre
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of  dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this that  Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and that she  was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw  in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her  out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with  the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,  and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in  this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even  while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my  being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian’s  declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.  In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there  before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in  this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which  her life was hidden from the sun.",see wretche bitter sense dependence degradation see estella set wreak miss havisham revenge man give gratify term see reason assign send attract torment mischief miss havisham send malicious assurance reach admirer stake cast secure lose see torment perversion ingenuity prize reserve see reason stave long reason late guardian decline commit formal knowledge scheme word see miss havisham eye eye see distinct shadow darkened unhealthy house life hide sun
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on  the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the  steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I  looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the  stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the  table and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly  reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I  saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated  and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across  the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it  were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the  crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as  they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the  gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.",candle light room place sconce wall high ground burn steady dulness artificial light air seldom renew look round pale gloom stop clock withered article bridal dress table ground awful figure ghostly reflection throw large fire ceiling wall see construction mind come repeat throw thought pass great room landing table spread see write fall cobwebs centre piece crawling spider cloth track mouse betook little quicken heart panel groping pausing beetle floor

I took  advantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the  room, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement of  my hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great  chimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham’s grey  hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and  was a miserable sight to see.",miss havisham settle hardly know floor fade bridal relic strew take advantage moment seek leave room beseech estella attention movement hand leave estella stand great chimney piece stand miss havisham grey hair adrift ground bridal wreck miserable sight
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an  hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about  the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I  found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up some stitches  in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and  of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old  banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella  and I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and played  French games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.",depressed heart walk starlight hour courtyard brewery ruin garden take courage return room find estella sit miss havisham knee take stitch old article dress drop piece remind fade tatter old banner see hang cathedral estella play card skilful play french evening wear away go bed
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first  time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to  come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this  side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind  the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the  room overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere. At last, when the night  was slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutely  could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I  must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out  across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the  outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no  sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss  Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I  followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She  carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from  one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by  its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed  air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard  her walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again  into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark  both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some  streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During  the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I  heard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless  low cry.",lie separate building courtyard time lain rest satis house sleep refuse come near thousand miss havishams haunt pillow head bed foot half open door dressing room dressing room room overhead room night slow creep feel absolutely long bear place place lie get clothe go yard long stone passage design gain outer courtyard walk relief mind soon passage extinguish candle see miss havisham go ghostly manner make low cry follow distance see staircase carry bare candle hand probably take sconce room unearthly object light stand staircase feel mildew air feast chamber see open door hear walk room cease low cry time try dark streak day stray show lay hand interval go staircase hear footstep see light pass hear ceaseless low cry

Dickens,Great Expectations,"On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and  when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody’s  agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to  order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,  according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute’s  turn to do that day.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy  creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it  as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place  and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable  Finch’s impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked about  coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of  expression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew  nothing.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,  after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The  debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more  honourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they  believed _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was  decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle  would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that  he had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,  as a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmth  which.” Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour  should take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a  polite little avowal in Estella’s hand, that she had had the honour of  dancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret  that I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole to  repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.  Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the  Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the  promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing  rate.",possible christian country blood question finches divide debate grow lively honourable member tell discussion believe know find decide grove court honour drummle bring slight certificate lady import honour acquaintance pip express regret gentleman finch have betray warmth day appoint production lest honour cold delay day drummle appear polite little avowal estella hand honour dance time leave course regret betray warmth repudiate untenable idea find drummle sit snort hour grove engage indiscriminate contradiction finally promotion good feeling declare go ahead amazing rate

For, I cannot  adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should  show any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far  below the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been  referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my  love for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to  that hound.

So furious had been the  gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their  roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of  windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast,  of shipwreck and death.

When the rain came with it and dashed  against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked,  that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.  Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it  could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors  open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out;  and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black  windows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the  teeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were  blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were  shuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being  carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.",alteration temple time lonely character expose river live house wind rush river shake house night like discharge cannon breaking sea rain come dash window think raise eye rock fancy storm beat lighthouse occasionally smoke come roll chimney bear night set door open look staircase staircase lamp blow shade face hand look black window open little question tooth wind rain see lamp court blow lamp bridge shore shudder coal fire barge river carry away wind like red hot splash rain

That, for weeks  gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like  his. That these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over  the sea, had drawn nearer.

Assured of this, I softly removed the  key to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat  down by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the  floor.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was  self-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would  inevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service  now, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by  an animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room  secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They  both had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically  looking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted;  indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny.

The wind  being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the  lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we  examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one  there. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have  slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman’s, and  leaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including  the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep.

Yes, he said; at different times of the  night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in  the Lane, and he had seen them all go home.

I seemed to have been  dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an  hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up  uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,  making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into  a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.",light fire burn raw pale flare time morning fall doze doze night clock strike hour half daylight doze wake uneasily prolix conversation ear make thunder wind chimney length fall profound sleep daylight wake start

But it was by no means so  plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved  his consent to Herbert’s participation until he should have seen him  and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. “And even then,  dear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out  of his pocket, “we’ll have him on his oath.”",appear well secure quiet lodge hard possession herbert return expect day secret confide herbert matter unavoidable necessity immense relief derive share question plain means plain provis resolve reserve consent herbert participation see form favourable judgment physiognomy dear boy say pull greasy little clasped black testament pocket oath
Dickens,Great Expectations,"To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about  the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to  state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never  knew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of  having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his  knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that  wise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or  charm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he  had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had  described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in  his solitude.",state terrible patron carry little black book world solely swear people case emergency state establish know use book appearance have steal court justice knowledge antecedent combine experience wise give reliance power sort legal spell charm occasion produce recall swear fidelity churchyard long ago describe night swear resolution solitude
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he  looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next  discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an  extraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and had  in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him  something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable  difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a  prosperous farmer’s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,  and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the  laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until  his change of dress was made.",present dress seafaring slop suit look parrot cigar dispose discuss dress wear cherish extraordinary belief virtue short disguise mind sketch dress dean dentist considerable difficulty win assumption dress like prosperous farmer arrange cut hair close wear little powder lastly see laundress niece view change dress

The more I dressed  him and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching  fugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly  referable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar  to me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there  were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was  Convict in the very grain of the man.",day clothe order come home dismally wear thinking hopeless attempt disguise dress well dress look like slouching fugitive marsh effect anxious fancy partly referable doubt old face manner grow familiar believe drag leg weight iron head foot convict grain man

Every hour so increased my abhorrence of  him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the  first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for  me and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon  come back.

When he  was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged  pack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since, and  in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the  table,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would  ask me to read to him,—“Foreign language, dear boy!” While I complied,  he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire  surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between  the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb  show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency.

Difficult as it is in a  large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is  conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that  any of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who  were passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty  when I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate  with us, nobody went in at the gate with me.

I was to be  absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his  impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be  begun.

In those times a bed  was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the  chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next  in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in  order on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the  back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling  over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the  fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched  little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.",turn temple gate soon read warning good way fleet street get late hackney chariot drive hummums covent garden time bed get hour night chamberlain let ready wicket light candle order shelf show straight bedroom order list sort vault ground floor despotic monster post bedstead straddle place put arbitrary leg fireplace doorway squeeze wretched little washing stand divinely righteous manner
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,  before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those  virtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which  instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever  be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the  bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a  staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and  lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more  close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.  And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one  another.",ask night light chamberlain bring leave good old constitutional rushlight virtuous day object like ghost walk cane instantly break touch light place solitary confinement high tin tower perforate round hole staringly wide awake pattern wall get bed lie footsore weary wretched find close eye close eye foolish argus gloom death night stare
Dickens,Great Expectations,"What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an  inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I  looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a  number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from the  market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying  by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever  tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—a  disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable  approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those  extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves  audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little  washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the  chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired  a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw  written, DON’T GO HOME.",doleful night anxious dismal long inhospitable smell room cold soot hot dust look corner tester head think number blue bottle fly butcher earwig market grub country hold lie summer lead speculate tumble fancy feel light fall disagreeable turn thought suggest objectionable approach lain awake little extraordinary voice silence teem begin audible closet whisper fireplace sigh little washing stand tick guitar string play occasionally chest drawer time eye wall acquire new expression stare round see write home
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never  warded off this DON’T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I  thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had  read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums  in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had  been found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that  he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to  assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door  to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship  of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But  all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,  and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were  questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed  there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I  thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I  recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and  tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I was  pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don’t go home.  When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a  vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present  tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do  not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may  not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and  should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and  rolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the  wall again.",night fancy night noise crowd ward home plait think bodily pain long read newspaper gentleman unknown come hummums night go bed destroy find morning welter blood come head occupy vault get bed assure red mark open door look passage cheer companionship distant light near know chamberlain doze time home happen home home provis safe home question occupy mind busily suppose room theme think estella part day forever recall circumstance parting look tone action finger pursue caution home doze sheer exhaustion mind body vast shadowy verb conjugate imperative mood present tense thou home let home let home ye home let home potentially home home feel go distract roll pillow look stare round wall

Then  he placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “All  right, ain’t you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “All  right, John, my boy, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacit  understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was  therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in  complete ignorance of these proceedings.",take toasting fork sausage speak set forth aged breakfast neatly little tray previous place go aged room clean white cloth tie old gentleman chin prop nightcap give rakish air place breakfast great care say right ai aged cheerful aged reply right john boy right tacit understanding aged presentable state consider invisible pretence complete ignorance proceeding

When I had begun to advance Herbert’s  prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful  philosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not  been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;  and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara’s esteem,  and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged  messages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her.

Now, I thought very  well of it, for three reasons I’ll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.

Now, another great advantage of all this is, that  it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself  about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off  and quite otherwise engaged.

After several times falling short of my destination and  as often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill  Pond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered,  where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there  were two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined  windmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,—whose long and  narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden  frames set in the ground, that looked like superannuated  haymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.",matter strand ship repair dry dock lose old hull ship course knock piece ooze slime dreg tide yard ship builder ship breaker rusty anchor blindly bite ground year duty mountainous country accumulate cask timber rope walk old green copper time fall short destination overshoot come unexpectedly round corner mill pond bank fresh kind place circumstance consider wind river room turn round tree stump ruin windmill old green copper rope long narrow vista trace moonlight series wooden frame set ground look like superannuated haymaking rake grow old lose tooth

That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly  woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was  immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the  parlour and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very  familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room  and region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at the  corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the  chimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representing  the death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George  the Third in a state coachman’s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots,  on the terrace at Windsor.",select queer house mill pond bank house wooden story bow window bay window thing look plate door read whimple want knock elderly woman pleasant thriving appearance respond immediately depose herbert silently lead parlour shut door odd sensation familiar face establish home unfamiliar room region find look look corner cupboard glass china shell chimney piece coloured engraving wall represent death captain cook ship launch majesty king george state coachman wig leather breech boot terrace windsor

Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned way of  looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and  something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of  yielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm; and something so gentle in  her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks’s Basin,  and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the  beam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between her and  Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.",natural win clara resign way look store detail herbert point confiding loving innocent modest manner yield herbert embrace arm gentle need protection mill pond bank chinks basin old green copper rope walk old barley growl undo engagement herbert money pocket book open

Dickens,Great Expectations,"In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and  airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found  Provis comfortably settled.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection had  resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting  Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might  otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own  destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his  fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s judgment  and sources of information?",opportunity day rest give reflection result fully determine respect compeyson know animosity man lead seek rush destruction herbert sit fire ask rely wemmick judgment source information

I added, that of course, when the time  came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might  be safest in Wemmick’s judgment. What was to follow that I did not  touch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it  in my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in  declared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by  enlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled  and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it  were no worse?",accurately reservation mention tell wemmick hear newgate prison officer prisoner suspicion chamber watch wemmick recommend keeping close time keeping away wemmick say get abroad add course time come follow close safe wemmick judgment follow touch clear comfortable mind see soft condition declare peril sake alter way live enlarge expense present unsettled difficult circumstance simply ridiculous bad
Dickens,Great Expectations,"He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His  coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a  venture.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that  something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’s  suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. “We are both good  watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the  right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no  boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance  is worth saving. Never mind the season; don’t you think it might be a  good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,  and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river?

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no  appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the  foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name  of Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.  Campbell. He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there  was, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a  strong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a  secluded life. So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple and  Clara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr.  Campbell, but kept it to myself.",old barley growl swear repasse door appearance have cease meaning cease get foot stair ask herbert preserve provis reply certainly lodger campbell explain utmost know campbell herbert campbell consign feel strong personal interest care live secluded life go parlour whimple clara seat work say interest campbell keep
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of  the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a  little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk  had grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the  hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were  redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’s Basin to fill it  to overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and  went home very sadly.",take leave pretty gentle dark eyed girl motherly woman outlive honest sympathy little affair true love feel old green copper rope walk grow different place old barley old hill swear like field trooper redeem youth trust hope chinks basin fill overflow think estella parting go home sadly
Dickens,Great Expectations,"All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The  windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark  and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the  fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between  me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside  when he came in,—for I went straight to bed, dispirited and  fatigued,—made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,  he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as  solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.",thing quiet temple see window room lately occupy provis dark lounger garden court walk past fountain twice thrice descend step room herbert come bedside come go straight bed dispirit report open window look moonlight tell pavement solemnly pavement cathedral hour
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat  was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her  within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and  practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in  cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been  out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the  hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old  London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there  was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But  I knew well enough how to ‘shoot’ the bridge after seeing it done, and  so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to  Erith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were  pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the  blind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less  frequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single  word of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there  was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being  watched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning  persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.",day set boat soon boat bring round temple stair lie reach minute begin training practice herbert cold rain sleet take note time keep blackfriars bridge hour tide change take london bridge old london bridge day certain state tide race fall water give bad reputation know shoot bridge see begin row shipping pool erith time pass mill pond bank herbert pull pair oar go return see blind east come herbert rarely frequently time week bring single word intelligence alarming know cause alarm rid notion watch receive haunt idea undesigne person suspect watch hard calculate
Dickens,Great Expectations,"In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in  hiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to  stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,  and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards  Clara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,  and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going  swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.",short fear rash man hiding herbert say find pleasant stand window dark tide run think flow bear clara think dread flow magwitch black mark surface pursuer go swiftly silently surely
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,  and he made no sign.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed  for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the  want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve  it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But  I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more  money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and  plans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,  to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whether  it was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited by  his generosity since his revelation of himself.",worldly affair begin wear gloomy appearance press money creditor begin know want money mean ready money pocket relieve convert easily spare article jewelery cash determined heartless fraud money patron exist state uncertain thought plan send unopened pocket book herbert hold keeping feel kind satisfaction false kind true hardly know have profit generosity revelation
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella  was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a  conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had  confided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her  to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of  hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know?

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,  towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a  range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause  for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror  fresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would  with dread, for Herbert’s returning step at night, lest it should be  fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,—for all that, and  much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to  inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed  about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.",unhappy life live dominant anxiety tower anxiety like high mountain range mountain disappear view new cause fear arise let start bed terror fresh discover let sit listen dread herbert return step night lest fleeter ordinary wing evil like purpose round thing go condemn inaction state constant restlessness suspense row boat wait wait wait well
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could  not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London  Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be  brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing  this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the  water-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings  that I have now to tell of.",state tide have river eddy chafe arch starling old london bridge leave boat wharf near custom house bring temple stair averse serve boat commoner incident water people slight occasion spring meeting tell
Dickens,Great Expectations,"One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the  wharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,  and had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had  become foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back  among the shipping, pretty carefully.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort  myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and  solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would  afterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved  his questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it is  nowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that  Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the  contrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously  heard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection  with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen  him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red  brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.",raw evening cold think comfort dinner hour dejection solitude go home temple think play theatre wopsle achieve questionable triumph water neighbourhood theatre resolve aware wopsle succeed revive drama contrary partake decline ominously hear play bill faithful black connection little girl noble birth monkey herbert see predatory tartar comic propensity face like red brick outrageous hat bell
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,  where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every  half-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the  knives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the  Lord Mayor’s dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the time  in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of  dinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.",dine herbert geographical chop house map world porter pot rim half yard tablecloth chart gravy day scarcely single chop house lord mayor dominion wear time doze crumb stare gas bake hot blast dinner rouse go play
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty’s service,—a most  excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so  tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked all  the little men’s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and  brave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying taxes, though he was  very patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in  the cloth, and on that property married a young person in  bed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of  Portsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach  to rub their own hands and shake everybody else’s, and sing “Fill,  fill!” A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn’t fill, or  do anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly  stated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed  to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so  effectually done (the Swab family having considerable political  influence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then  it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white  hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a  gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down  from behind with the gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he had  overheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle’s (who had never been heard of  before) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of  great power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all  to go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down  the Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The  boatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on  the Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your  Honour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,  conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into  a dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that  corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of  me.",find virtuous boatswain majesty excellent man wish trouser tight place loose knock little man hat eye generous brave hear anybody pay taxis patriotic bag money pocket like pudding cloth property marry young person bed furniture great rejoicing population portsmouth number census turn beach rub hand shake everybody sing fill fill certain dark complexion swab fill propose heart openly state boatswain black figure head propose swabs mankind difficulty effectually swab family have considerable political influence take half evening set thing right bring honest little grocer white hat black gaiter red nose get clock gridiron listen come knock everybody gridiron confute overhear lead wopsle hear come star garter plenipotentiary great power direct admiralty swabs prison spot bring boatswain union jack slight acknowledgment public service boatswain unmanned time respectfully dry eye jack cheer address wopsle honour solicit permission fin wopsle concede fin gracious dignity immediately shove dusty corner everybody dance hornpipe corner survey public discontent eye aware
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in  the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.  Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric  countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in  the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great  cowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.  But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,  the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,—on account of  the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of  his daughter’s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a  flour-sack, out of the first-floor window,—summoned a sententious  Enchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,  after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a  high-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.  The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked  at, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various  colours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with  great surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he  were lost in amazement.",second piece new grand comic christmas pantomime scene pain suspect detect wopsle red worsted leg highly magnify phosphoric countenance shock red curtain fringe hair engage manufacture thunderbolt display great cowardice gigantic master come home hoarse dinner presently present worthy circumstance genius youthful love want account parental brutality ignorant farmer oppose choice daughter heart purposely fall object flour sack floor sententious enchanter come antipode unsteadily apparently violent journey prove wopsle high crown hat necromantic work volume arm business enchanter earth principally talk sing butted dance flash fire colour good deal time hand observe great surprise devote stare direction lose amazement
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.  Wopsle’s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his  mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out.

How  was he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,  in black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not.

I wrote it before I  went to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.  Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very  cautious.

As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its rising  and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were  playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,  fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a  corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance  of a host of hanged clients.",office little britain usual letter writing hand wash candle snuffing safe locking close business day stand idle jaggers fire rise fall flame cast shelf look play diabolical game bo peep pair coarse fat office candle dimly light jaggers write corner decorate dirty winding sheet remembrance host hanged client

Although I should not have  thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much  as a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no  objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it  was not to be done.

I looked at those  hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I  compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,  and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and  a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the  housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over  me when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through the  deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I  saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach  window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like  lightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a sudden  glare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association  had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,  wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a  chance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knitting  action, and the attentive eyes.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of  meaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a  desperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and  he worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to  have made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day  for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial  where he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every one  knew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,—a  woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.  It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman  in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick  (as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of  jealousy. The murdered woman,—more a match for the man, certainly, in  point of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had  been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched  and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,  there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this  woman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.  Jaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick,  touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of  her hands then, though he sometimes does now.”",jaggers pursue wemmick look meaning work case way astonishing desperate case comparatively early day work general admiration fact say work police office day day day contend committal trial work sit counsel know salt pepper murdered person woman good year old large strong case jealousy lead tramping life woman gerrard street marry young broomstick tramping man perfect fury point jealousy murder match man certainly point year find dead barn near hounslow heath violent struggle fight bruise scratch torn hold throat choke reasonable evidence implicate person woman improbability have able jagger principally rest case sure say wemmick touch sleeve dwelt strength hand

Dickens,Great Expectations,"“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t you  see?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her  apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in  particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully  contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a  bruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of her  hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?  Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of  brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not  have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles  were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the  fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have  been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little  spots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made  was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that  she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the  murder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years  old—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:  “We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and  we show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and  you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept  all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have  destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have  scratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder  of her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you _will_ have  scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted  for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented  them?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too  many for the jury, and they gave in.”",sir wemmick go happen happen woman artfully dressed time apprehension look slighter particular sleeve remember skilfully contrive arm delicate look bruise back hand lacerate question finger nail jaggers show struggle great lot bramble high face get keep hand bit bramble actually find skin evidence fact bramble question find examination break little shred dress little spot blood bold point attempt set proof jealousy strong suspicion have time murder frantically destroy child man year old revenge jaggers work way mark finger nail mark bramble bramble mark finger nail set hypothesis destroy child accept consequence hypothesis know destroy child child cling scratch hand try murder child case scratch know account assume sake argument invent sum sir say wemmick jaggers altogether jury give

The nooks of ruin where the old  monks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong  walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,  were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral  chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried  on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell  of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the  rooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high  trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was  changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.",good light day go pass quiet echo court high street nook ruin old monk refectory garden strong wall press service humble shed stable silent old monk grave cathedral chime sadder remote sound hurry avoid observation swell old organ bear ear like funeral music rook hover grey tower swung bare high tree priory garden place change estella go

I had first seen him when I sent for  him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the  newspapers, before I and the world parted.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I  called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I  would not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before  leaving.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little  door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at  the opposite door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started  and swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was  encumbered with a growth of fungus,—when I turned my head to look back.  A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of  the slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to  the beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam  shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,—though to be  sure I was there in an instant.",take brewery way raise rusty latch little door garden end walk go opposite easy open damp wood start swell hinge yield threshold encumber growth turn head look childish association revive wonderful force moment slight action fancy see miss havisham hang beam strong impression stand beam shudder head foot know sure instant
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this  illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an  indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I  had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on  into the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let  me out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go  upstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I  had left her.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in  the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back  towards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly  away, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw  her running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about  her, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.",look room leave see seat ragged chair hearth close fire moment withdraw head quietly away see great flame light spring moment see run shriek whirl fire blaze soar foot head high

Dickens,Great Expectations,"On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,  but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay  mainly in the nervous shock.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had  happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she  began to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that  she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, “What have I done!”  And then, “When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like  mine.” And then, “Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgive  her!’” She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she  sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in  another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.",stage evening speak collectedly happen certain terrible vivacity midnight begin wander speech gradually set say innumerable time low solemn voice come mean save misery like pencil write forgive change order sentence leave word put word leave blank go word

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in  the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less  severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames  had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My  right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It  was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand  and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like  a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck.

If I dozed  for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham’s cries, and by her  running at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain of  the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I  suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention  engaged.",lie quiet sofa find painfully difficult impossible rid impression glare flame hurry noise fierce burning smell doze minute awaken miss havisham cry run height fire head pain mind hard strive bodily pain suffer herbert see utmost hold attention engaged

Therefore, fearing he should be  called upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause  of her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept  himself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was  only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the  jealousy arose.

I really do not know whether I  felt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad to  transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some  rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me.

On the understanding,  again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.  Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my  hurts looked after, and to stay at home.

On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into  Mr. Jaggers’s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the  outer office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post that morning, I knew  what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick  together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to  compromise him.",periodical occasion jaggers wemmick go office account check voucher thing straight occasion wemmick take book paper jaggers room upstairs clerk come outer office find clerk wemmick post morning know go sorry jaggers wemmick wemmick hear say compromise

Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief  account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to  give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused  our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the  rules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the  disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.  Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the  pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.  The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official  proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn’t  smell fire at the present moment.",appearance arm bandage coat loose shoulder favour object send jaggers brief account accident soon arrive town detail speciality occasion cause talk dry hard strictly regulate rule evidence describe disaster jaggers stand accord wo nt fire wemmick lean chair stare hand pocket trouser pen horizontally post brutal cast inseparable mind official proceeding congestively consider smell fire present moment

Mr. Jaggers’s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when  I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,  with instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was  in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.  Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked  on at me. “I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I put the check in my pocket,  when he had signed it, “that we do nothing for _you_.”",narrative finish question exhaust produce miss havisham authority receive pound herbert jaggers eye retire little deeply head hand tablet presently hand wemmick instruction draw check signature course look wemmick write jagger poise sway polish boot look sorry pip say check pocket sign

This I had strongly suspected from Provis’s  account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;  which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers’s  client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason  for claiming his identity.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation  that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact  knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look  towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been  for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’s look.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a  passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and  manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had  lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had  made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I  represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence  from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said  that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted  assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,  and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he  cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,  and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,  whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything  else in the world.

For this reason, I suppose, they were now  inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and  Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest  point in abeyance for a moment.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the  point, almost indifferent what port we made for,—Hamburg, Rotterdam,  Antwerp,—the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any  foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I  had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the  boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for  search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would  leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get  down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot  until we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we  lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we  made inquiries beforehand.",anxious consideration give point indifferent port rotterdam place signify little england foreign steamer fall way propose river boat certainly gravesend critical place search inquiry suspicion afoot foreign steamer leave london time high water plan river previous ebb tide lie quiet spot pull time lay calculate pretty nearly inquiry

We found that a steamer for  Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our  thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign  steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied  ourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated  for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;  Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do  without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported it  done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen  Startop, and he was more than ready to join.",herbert assent go immediately breakfast pursue investigation find steamer hamburg likely suit purpose well direct thought chiefly vessel note foreign steamer leave london tide satisfy know build colour separate hour passport necessary herbert startop lodging hindrance meet report prepare passport herbert see startop ready join

Yielding to it in the same  mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling  him that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I  had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss  Havisham was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock  up the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If  I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have  missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out  of the yard.

The morning  hurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had  waited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now  I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt  whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider  whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against  ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through  all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose  very few hurried people are strangers.

The striking of the clock aroused me, but not  from my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened  round my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for  the letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,  and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of  the coach.

I quickened  my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,  I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,  and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against  the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and  ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kiln  crept in a ghostly way towards me.

As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?”  but no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it  was past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being still  no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.",rise hand door yield look see light candle table bench mattress truckle bedstead loft call voice answer look watch find past call answer go door irresolute

Seeing nothing save what I had seen  already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the  shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was  considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be  coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head  to look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken  up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent  shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in  a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.",begin rain fast see save see turn house stand shelter doorway look night consider lately soon come candle burn come head look wick long turn round take candle hand extinguish violent shock thing comprehend catch strong running noose throw head

The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible  than death was the dread of being misremembered after death.

Above all things, I  resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some  last poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of  men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of  Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no  farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to  me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my  miserable errors,—still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I  would have done it.",pass thought cry help know well solitary nature spot hopelessness aid sit gloat support scornful detestation seal lip thing resolve entreat die make poor resistance soften thought rest man dire extremity humbly beseech pardon heaven melt heart thought take farewell farewell dear explain ask compassion miserable kill die

Dickens,Great Expectations,"He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the  bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly  understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an  end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew  that when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept  towards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he  would do as he had done in my sister’s case,—make all haste to the  town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years  while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented  pictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of  my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons  without seeing them.

But, they  tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully  replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain  some cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the  door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the  quarry on our way back. Trabb’s boy—Trabb’s overgrown young man  now—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come  in at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I  had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,—which at  first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining  quiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our  chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had  met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was  gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the  inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His  uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an  hour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who  volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.  Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his  uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he  resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the  Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,  finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham’s, where they lost me.  Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when  I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh  themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.  Among the loungers under the Boar’s archway happened to be Trabb’s  Boy,—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he  had no business,—and Trabb’s boy had seen me passing from Miss  Havisham’s in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb’s boy became  their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by  the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went  along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought  there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’s  safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be  mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and  went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,  endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could  hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was  while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I  was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,  and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.",entreating herbert tell come flatly refuse insist remain learn hurry drop letter open chamber come home bring startop meet street way find soon go tone uneasy inconsistency hasty letter leave uneasiness increase instead subsiding quarter hour consideration set coach office startop volunteer company inquiry coach go find afternoon coach go find uneasiness grow positive alarm obstacle come way resolve follow post chaise startop arrive blue boar fully expect find tiding find go miss havisham lose go hotel doubtless time hear popular local version story refresh guide marsh lounger boar archway happen trabb ancient habit happen trabb boy see pass miss havisham direction dining place trabb boy guide go sluice house town way marsh avoid go herbert reflect bring genuine serviceable errand tend provis safety bethink case interruption mischievous leave guide startop edge quarry go steal round house time endeavour ascertain right hear indistinct sound deep rough voice mind busy begin doubt suddenly cry loudly answer cry rush closely follow
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our  immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it  was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such  a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be  fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we  relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the  present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather  light of the matter to Trabb’s boy; who, I am convinced, would have  been much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his  intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb’s boy was of a  malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it  was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody’s  expense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed  to meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an  ill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).",tell herbert pass house immediately go magistrate town late night get warrant consider course detain bind come fatal provis gainsay difficulty relinquish thought pursue orlick time present circumstance deem prudent light matter trabb boy convinced affect disappointment know intervention save limekiln trabb boy malignant nature spare vivacity constitution want variety excitement anybody expense part present guinea meet view tell sorry ill opinion impression

Herbert  got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this  stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear  its pain on the journey.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from  communication with him that day; yet this again increased my  restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing  that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me  so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was  something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the  fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days  wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,  my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow  morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning  head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to  high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew  in prose and verse.

Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the  notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and  the opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed  and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for  four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past.

The river, still dark and mysterious, was  spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there  at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the  clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the  unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn  from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.  From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.",wednesday morning dawn look window winking light bridge pale come sun like marsh fire horizon river dark mysterious span bridge turn coldly grey warm touch burning sky look cluster roof church tower spire shoot unusually clear air sun rise veil draw river million sparkle burst water veil draw feel strong

We  had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly  possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the  bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were  questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for  it was wholly set on Provis’s safety.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if  we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had  taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After  a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two  or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went  on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being  with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,  and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long  reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is  broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and  where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we  could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all  night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would  start from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at  what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail  the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we  should have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each  vessel.",plan tide begin run intend creep turn row dark long reach gravesend kent essex river broad solitary water inhabitant lone public house scatter choose resting place mean lie night steamer hamburg steamer rotterdam start london thursday morning know time expect accord hail accident take abroad chance know distinguish mark vessel
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was  so great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in  which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the  movement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ran  with us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us  on,—freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use  in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,  and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.",relief engage execution purpose great feel difficult realise condition hour crisp air sunlight movement river move river road run sympathise animate encourage new hope feel mortify little use boat well oarsman friend row steady stroke day
Dickens,Great Expectations,"At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present  extent, and watermen’s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing  colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but  of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so  many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and  there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;  the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a  much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and  we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.",time steam traffic thames far present extent waterman boat far numerous barge sailing collier coasting trader steam ship great small tithe twentieth early plenty sculler go morning plenty barge drop tide navigation river bridge open boat easy commoner matter day go ahead skiff wherry briskly
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its  oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor’s Gate, and  we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,  and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking  immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were  colliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off  stages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,  which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her  moorings was to-morrow’s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good  notice; and here to-morrow’s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we  crossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster  beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.",old london bridge soon pass old billingsgate market oyster boat dutchmen white tower traitor gate tier shipping leith aberdeen glasgow steamer loading unload good look immensely high water pass alongside collier score score coal whipper plunge stage deck counterweight measure coal swinge rattle barge mooring morrow steamer rotterdam take good notice morrow hamburg bowsprit cross sit stern fast beat heart mill pond bank mill pond stair

Dickens,Great Expectations,"At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had  looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We  certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not  either attended or followed by any boat.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural  part of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he  had led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.  He was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his  gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not  disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no  notion of meeting danger half way.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he  should have endangered his freedom, and even his life.

Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been  in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer  into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he  would be safest where he was, and he said. “Do you, dear boy?” and  quietly sat down again.",pipe mouth undisturbed expression face sit compose content england submissive word advice constant terror run ashore bottle beer boat step hint think safe say dear boy quietly sit
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the  sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose  none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By  imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of  the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the  muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.  As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a  boat or two’s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch  the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a  large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And  soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,  and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking  advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us  in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of  the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and  mudbanks.",air feel cold river bright day sunshine cheering tide run strong take care lose steady stroke carry thoroughly imperceptible degree tide run lose nearer wood hill drop lower low muddy bank tide gravesend charge wrap cloak purposely pass boat length float custom house catch stream alongside emigrant ship bow large transport troop forecastle look soon tide begin slacken craft lie anchor swing presently swung round ship take advantage new tide pool begin crowd fleet keep shore strength tide stand carefully low shallow mudbank
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive  with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour’s rest  proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery  stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It  was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim  horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great  floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed  stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round  the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,  straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some  ballast-lighters, shaped like a child’s first rude imitation of a boat,  lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles  stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes  stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red  landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage  and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was  stagnation and mud.",oarsman fresh dint have occasionally let drive tide minute quarter hour rest prove want get ashore slippery stone eat drink look like marsh country flat monotonous dim horizon winding river turn turn great float buoy turn turn strand fleet ship round low point head green barge straw laden brown sail follow ballast lighter shape like child rude imitation boat lie low mud little squat shoal lighthouse open pile stand crippled mud stilt crutch slimy stake stick mud slimy stone stick mud red landmark tidemark stick mud old landing stage old roofless building slip mud stagnation mud
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder  work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and  rowed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a  little, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on  the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into  black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were  the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,  save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.",push way hard work herbert startop persevered row row row sun go time river lift little bank red sun low level shore purple haze fast deepen black solitary flat marsh far away rise ground life save foreground melancholy gull
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,  would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for  clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could  find. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for  anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or  five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with  her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.  The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and  what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as  the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.",night fast fall moon past rise early hold little council short clearly course lie lonely tavern find ply oar look like house hold speak little dull mile cold collier come galley fire smoking flaring look like comfortable home night dark time morning light come river sky oar dipping strike reflected star
Dickens,Great Expectations,"At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we  were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular  intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or  other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and  there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little  creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them  nervously. Sometimes, “What was that ripple?” one of us would say in a  low voice. Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards we would  fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with  what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.",dismal time evidently possess idea follow tide flap heavily irregular interval shore sound come sure start look direction set current wear bank little creek suspicious place eye nervously ripple low voice boat yonder fall dead silence sit impatiently think unusual noise oar work thowel
Dickens,Great Expectations,"At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran  alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard  by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light  to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I  dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good  fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various  liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—“such as  they were,” the landlord said. No other company was in the house than  the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the “Jack” of the  little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been  low-water mark too.",length descry light roof presently run alongside little causeway stone pick hard leave rest boat step ashore find light window public house dirty place dare unknown smuggle adventurer good fire kitchen egg bacon eat liquor drink double bedded landlord say company house landlord wife grizzled male creature jack little causeway slimy smeary low water mark
Dickens,Great Expectations,"With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came  ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all  else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the  kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop  were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as  carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there  were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have  thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,  notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.",assistant go boat come ashore bring oar rudder boat hook haul night good meal kitchen fire apportion bedroom herbert startop occupy charge find air carefully exclude air fatal life dirty clothe bandbox bed think family possess consider notwithstanding solitary place find
Dickens,Great Expectations,"While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the  Jack—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes  on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as  interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a  drowned seaman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oared  galley going up with the tide?

Dickens,Great Expectations,"This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind  was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and  I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley  hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an  ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced  Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop  by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.  Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer’s time,  which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off  early in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we  deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour  or so of the steamer’s time, and then to get out in her track, and  drift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into  the house and went to bed.",dialogue uneasy uneasy dismal wind mutter round house tide flap shore feeling cage threaten oare galley hover unusual way attract notice ugly circumstance rid induce provis bed go outside companion startop time know state case hold council remain house near steamer time afternoon early morning question discuss deem well course lie hour steamer time track drift easily tide have settle return house go bed
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a  few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house  (the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled  me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the  window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,  as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw  two men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at  nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I  could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction  of the Nore.",lie great clothe sleep hour awake wind rise sign house ship creak bang noise startle rise softly charge lie fast asleep look window command causeway haul boat eye adapt light clouded moon see man look pass window look landing place discern strike marsh direction nore

But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back  of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder  day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I  could see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I  soon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the  matter, and fell asleep again.",impulse herbert man go away reflect get room house adjoin startop hard day fatigue forbear go window man move marsh light soon lose feel cold lie think matter fall asleep
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before  breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our  charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the  men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no  thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed,  it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away  together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take  us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about  noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he  and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.",early walk fro breakfast deem right recount see charge anxious party likely man belong custom house say quietly thought try persuade easily propose walk away distant point boat aboard near prove feasible noon consider good precaution soon breakfast set forth say tavern
Dickens,Great Expectations,"He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me  on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in  danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As  we approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,  while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had  passed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no  boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were  there any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the  tide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.",smoke pipe go stop clap shoulder suppose danger reassure speak little approach point beg remain sheltered place go reconnoitre man pass night comply go boat point boat draw near sign man have embark sure tide high footprint water
Dickens,Great Expectations,"When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I  waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;  sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving  about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got  aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that  time it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock, and we began to look out  for her smoke.",look shelter distance see wave hat come rejoin wait lie bank wrap coat move warm see boat come round get aboard easily row track steamer time want minute begin look smoke
Dickens,Great Expectations,"But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards  we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on  at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of  saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands  cordially, and neither Herbert’s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I  saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way  ahead of us, and row out into the same track.",half past see smoke soon see smoke steamer come speed get bag ready take opportunity say good bye herbert startop shake hand cordially herbert eye dry see oare galley shoot bank little way ahead row track
Dickens,Great Expectations,"A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer’s smoke,  by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,  coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the  tide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to  sit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, “Trust to  me, dear boy,” and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was  very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and  fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,  she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or  two when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and  looked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter was  wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some  instruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in  either boat.",stretch shore steamer smoke reason bend wind river visible come head call herbert startop tide lie adjure provis sit wrap cloak answer cheerily trust dear boy sit like statue meantime galley skilfully handle cross let come fall alongside leave room play oar keep alongside drift drift pull stroke pull sitter hold rudder line look rower sitter wrap provis shrink whisper instruction steerer look word speak boat
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,  and gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice, as we sat face to face.  She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew  louder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,  when the galley hailed us. I answered.",startop minute steamer give word hamburg low voice sit face face near fast beating peddle grow louder louder feel shadow absolutely galley hail answer

Dickens,Great Expectations,"At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,  he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke  ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on  to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great  confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and  heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but  felt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw  the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner’s shoulder,  and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,  and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite  frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,  lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the  shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that  the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.  Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white  terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board  the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink  from under me.",moment give audible direction crew run galley abroad pull sudden stroke ahead get oar run athwart hold gunwale know cause great confusion board steamer hear call hear order give stop paddle hear stop feel drive irresistibly moment see steersman galley lie hand prisoner shoulder see boat swinge round force tide see hand board steamer run forward frantically moment see prisoner start lean captor pull cloak neck shrink sitter galley moment see face disclose face convict long ago moment see face tilt backward white terror shall forget hear great cry board steamer loud splash water feel boat sink
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand  mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was  taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;  but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.",instant struggle thousand mill weir thousand flash light instant past take board galley herbert startop boat go convict go
Dickens,Great Expectations,"What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of  her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first  distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the  galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong  strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and  eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,  bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up  his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and  true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,  but not swimming freely.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water  was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not  understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had  been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and  we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out  was kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were  gone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.",galley keep steady silent eager look water resume rotterdam steamer come apparently understand happen come speed time hail stop steamer drift away rise fall troubled wake water look keep long steamer go everybody know hopeless
Dickens,Great Expectations,"At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern  we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.  Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis no  longer,—who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a  deep cut in the head.",length give pull shore tavern lately leave receive little surprise able comfort receive severe injury chest deep cut head
Dickens,Great Expectations,"He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the  steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to  his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought  he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did  not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,  but that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify  him, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had  both gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him  (Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him  in it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down  fiercely locked in each other’s arms, and that there had been a  struggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,  and swum away.",tell believe go keel steamer strike head rise injury chest render breathing extremely painful think receive galley add pretend compeyson moment lay hand cloak identify villain stagger stagger go overboard sudden wrenching magwitch boat endeavour captor capsize tell whisper go fiercely lock arm struggle water disengage strike swum away

Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I asked this officer’s permission to change the prisoner’s wet  clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the  public-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take  charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book  which had once been in my hands passed into the officer’s. He further  gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to  accord that grace to my two friends.",ask officer permission change prisoner wet clothe purchase spare garment public house give readily merely observe charge prisoner pocket book hand pass officer give leave accompany prisoner london decline accord grace friend
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone  down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was  likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to  be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it  took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may  have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in  various stages of decay.",jack ship instruct drown man go undertake search body place likeliest come ashore interest recovery heighten hear stocking probably take dozen drown man fit completely reason different article dress stage decay
Dickens,Great Expectations,"We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then  Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board.

We had a  doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch’s side, I felt  that that was my place henceforth while he lived.",remain public house tide turn magwitch carry galley board herbert startop london land soon doleful parting take place magwitch feel place henceforth live
Dickens,Great Expectations,"For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,  wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man  who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,  gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a  series of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to  Joe.",repugnance melt away hunted wound shackle creature hold hand see man mean benefactor feel affectionately gratefully generously great constancy series year see well man joe
Dickens,Great Expectations,"His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,  and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm  I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I  could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was  unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,  people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not  doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away as  he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his  throat,—softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing  that he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might  not otherwise have thought of until too late,—that he need never know  how his hopes of enriching me had perished.",feel hand tremble hold turn face away lie boat hear old sound like rest good thing touch point mind think need know hope enrich perish
Dickens,Great Expectations,"  He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been  immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down  for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,  to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had  meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened  that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could  give the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his  private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and  Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing. It was the  sole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five  minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could  prevent its going against us.",take police court day immediately commit trial necessary send old officer prison ship escape speak identity doubt compeyson mean depose tumble tide dead happen time prison officer london require evidence go direct jaggers private house arrival night retain assistance jagger prisoner behalf admit sole resource tell case minute witness power earth prevent go
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the  fate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for  having “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialise  by and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal  from me that, although there might be many cases in which the  forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this  case to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not  related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;  he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his  apprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I  finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my  heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to  establish one.",impart jaggers design keep ignorance fate wealth jaggers querulous angry have let slip finger say memorialise try event conceal case forfeiture exact circumstance case understand relate outlaw connect recognisable tie hand writing settlement favour apprehension idle claim finally resolve abide resolution heart sicken hopeless task attempt establish
Dickens,Great Expectations,"There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had  hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some  accurate knowledge of Magwitch’s affairs. When his body was found, many  miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he  was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still  legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a  banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the  designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of  information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.  Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His  ignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but  that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers’s aid.",appear reason supposing drown informer hope reward forfeiture obtain accurate knowledge magwitch affair body find mile scene death horribly disfigure recognisable content pocket note legible fold case carry banking house new south wales sum money designation certain land considerable value head information list magwitch prison give jagger possession suppose inherit ignorance poor fellow serve mistrust inheritance safe jaggers aid
Dickens,Great Expectations,"After three days’ delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over  for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness  came, and completed the easy case.

I went into a coffee-house to write a little note  to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and  over again, and then went to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name;  for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.",saturday week take leave bright hope sad sorry leave sit seaport mail coach go coffee house write little note clara tell go send love go lonely deserve home home

I kept my ears open,  seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I  thought that would be the best time for making the attempt.

The  Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the  altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much  difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to  put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the  pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old  gentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe  resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to  perfection.",discreet damsel attire usual engage substitute green kid glove pair white aged likewise occupy prepare similar sacrifice altar hymen old gentleman experience difficulty get glove wemmick find necessary pillar pillar pull away hold old gentleman round waist present equal safe resistance dint ingenious scheme glove get perfection

Dickens,Great Expectations,"I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;  while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made a  feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of  giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the  clergyman’s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.  When he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?” the  old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we  had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.  Upon which, the clergyman said again, “WHO giveth this woman to be  married to this man?” The old gentleman being still in a state of most  estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed  voice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?” To which the Aged replied  with great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, “All right, John,  all right, my boy!” And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon  it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely  married that day.",act capacity backer good man bridegroom little limp pew opener soft bonnet like baby feint bosom friend miss skiffins responsibility give lady away devolve aged lead clergyman unintentionally scandalise happen say giveth woman married man old gentleman know point ceremony arrive stand amiably beam commandment clergyman say giveth woman married man old gentleman state estimable unconsciousness bridegroom cry accustomed voice aged know giveth aged reply great briskness say give right john right boy clergyman come gloomy pause doubt moment completely marry day

Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,  put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. “_Now_, Mr.  Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came  out, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a  wedding-party!”",completely go church wemmick take cover font white glove cover wemmick heedful future white glove pocket assume green pip say wemmick triumphantly shoulder fishing rod come let ask anybody suppose wedding party
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so  away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle  board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after  the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer  unwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in  a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,  and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have  done.",breakfast order pleasant little tavern mile away rise ground green bagatelle board room case desire unbend mind solemnity pleasant observe wemmick long unwound wemmick arm adapt figure sit high back chair wall like violoncello case submit embrace melodious instrument

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his  committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken  two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great  pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his  hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke  very little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the  first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he  ought to hear.",lie prison ill interval committal trial come round sessions break rib wound lung breathe great pain difficulty increase daily consequence hurt speak low scarcely audible speak little ready listen duty life read know ought hear

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man  who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner  or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered  over the question whether he might have been a better man under better  circumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that  way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.",kind submission resignation show man tired derive impression manner whisper word escape ponder question well man well circumstance justify hint tend way try bend past eternal shape
Dickens,Great Expectations,"It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his  desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in  attendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his  eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had  seen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was  a little child.

It  was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,  and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the  bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting  close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he  stretched forth to me.",sessions come round jaggers cause application postponement trial follow sessions obviously assurance live long refuse trial come bar seat chair objection get close dock outside hold hand stretch forth
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said  for him were said,—how he had taken to industrious habits, and had  thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that  he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It  was impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him  guilty.",trial short clear thing say take industrious habit thriven lawfully reputably unsay fact return presence judge jury impossible try find guilty
Dickens,Great Expectations,"At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible  experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing  of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of  Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds  before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that  I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that  sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,  that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.",time custom learn terrible experience sessions devote conclude day passing sentences finish effect sentence death indelible picture remembrance hold scarcely believe write word see thirty man woman judge receive sentence foremost thirty seat breath life
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,  down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering  in the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside  it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and  women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and  weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There  had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been  stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains  and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great  gallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as the  two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge  addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must  single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had  been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments  and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of  years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had  made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable  man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when  far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a  peaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those  propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered  him a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and  repentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.  Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading  the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of  flight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by express  design, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of his  denouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment  for his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his  case being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.",scene start vivid colour moment drop april rain window court glitter ray april sun pen dock stand outside corner hand thirty man woman defiant stricken terror sobbing weeping cover face stare gloomily shriek woman convict still hush succeed sheriff great chain nosegay civic gewgaw monster crier usher great gallery large theatrical thirty judge solemnly confront judge address wretched creature single special address infancy offender law repeat imprisonment punishment length sentence exile term year circumstance great violence daring escape sentence exile life miserable man time convinced error far remove scene old offence live peaceable honest life fatal moment yield propensity passion indulgence long render scourge society quit haven rest repentance come country proscribe presently denounce time succeed evade officer justice length seize act flight resist well know express design blindness hardihood cause death denouncer career know appoint punishment return land cast death case aggravate case prepare die
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the  glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of  light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,  and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,  with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all  things, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face  in this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I have received my  sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat down  again. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had  to say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of  them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard  look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three  shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had  taken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of  having to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held  my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got  up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),  and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him  and me.",sun strike great window court glitter drop rain glass broad shaft light thirty judge link remind audience pass absolute equality great judgment knoweth thing err rise moment distinct speck face way light prisoner say lord receive sentence death almighty bow sit hushing judge go rest formally doom support saunter haggard look bravery nod gallery shake hand go chew fragment herb take sweet herb lie go have help chair slowly hold hand remove audience get put dress right church point criminal
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder’s  Report was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that  night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting  forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my  sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I  had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men  in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the  Crown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took  no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed  in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away  from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful  and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable  restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,  wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.  To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,  dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and  their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.",earnestly hope pray die recorder report dread linger begin night write petition home secretary state set forth knowledge come sake write fervently pathetically finish send write petition man authority hope merciful draw crown day night sentence take rest fall asleep chair wholly absorb appeal send away place feel hopeful desperate near unreasonable restlessness pain mind roam street evening wander office house leave petition present hour weary western street london cold dusty spring night range stern shut mansion long row lamp melancholy association
Dickens,Great Expectations,"The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more  strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an  intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I  sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,  that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the  singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There  was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer  always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick  prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as  sick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be  thanked!) always joined in the same report.",daily visit shorten strictly keep see fancy suspect intention carry poison ask search sit bedside tell officer willing assure singleness design hard duty harshly officer give assurance bad sick prisoner room prisoner attend sick nurse malefactor incapable kindness god thank join report
Dickens,Great Expectations,"As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly  looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face  until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would  subside again.

At once I put bills  up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and  began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought  rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and  concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth  beyond the fact that I was falling very ill.

I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the  window-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw  Joe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was  Joe’s.

As I lay in bed looking at  him, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the  pride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its  curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as  the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the  room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own  writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,  Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the  pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his  sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was  necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,  and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;  and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might  have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen  spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on  the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into  space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was  tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he  got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had  removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with  his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the  effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,  with unbounded satisfaction.",evidently biddy teach joe write lie bed look weak state cry pleasure pride set letter bedstead divest curtain remove sitting room airy large carpet take away room keep fresh wholesome night day writing table push corner cumber little bottle joe sit great work choose pen pen tray chest large tool tuck sleeve go wield crow bar sledgehammer necessary joe hold heavily table left elbow right leg begin begin downstroke slowly foot long upstroke hear pen splutter extensively curious idea inkstand constantly dip pen space satisfied result occasionally trip orthographical stumbling block get sign remove finish blot paper crown head forefinger get hover table try effect performance point view lie unbounded satisfaction

He would sit and talk to me in  the old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old  unassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my  life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles  of the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the  household work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after  paying off the laundress on his first arrival. “Which I do assure you,  Pip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found her  a tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the  feathers in a bucket, for sale.

But when I heard the Sunday  bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I  felt that I was not nearly thankful enough,—that I was too weak yet to  be even that,—and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid it  long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too  much for my young senses.",joe get drive away country rich summer growth tree grass sweet summer scent fill air day happen sunday look loveliness think grow change little wild flower form voice bird strengthen day night sun star poor lay burning toss bed mere remembrance have burn toss come like check peace hear sunday bell look little outspread beauty feel nearly thankful weak lay head joe shoulder lay long ago take fair young sense

Dickens,Great Expectations,"“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe. “I done what I could to keep you and  Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my  inclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it  were not so much,” said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, “that  she dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that  she dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain’t a  grab at a man’s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your  sister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from getting a little  child out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into  heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up  and says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a-doing?

Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two  sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy  giv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost  awful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this  light, as I should so put it.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact  and kindness with which Biddy—who with her woman’s wit had found me out  so soon—had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But  whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all  dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not  understand.",delicacy joe dismiss theme sweet tact kindness biddy woman wit find soon prepare deep impression mind joe know poor great expectation dissolve like marsh mist sun understand
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to  develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension  of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less  easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear  fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,  the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears. I too had  fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,  imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe’s hold upon them began  to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to  understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was  all mine.",thing joe understand begin develop soon arrive sorrowful comprehension strong well joe little easy weakness entire dependence dear fellow fall old tone call old name dear old pip old chap music ear fall old way happy thankful let imperceptibly hold fast joe hold begin slacken wonder soon begin understand cause fault

Joe gave it me, but was  thoughtful.",word grate remonstrate walk gate garden pretend weak ask joe arm joe give thoughtful
Dickens,Great Expectations,"I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing  change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I  was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come  down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not  quite an unworthy one.

But, before we went to  bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,—to-morrow being  Sunday,—and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday  morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this  last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts  (that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go  out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of  my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before  breakfast.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how  humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost  all I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in  my first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, “Biddy, I think you  once liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed  away from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been  since. If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take  me with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can  receive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and  have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am  a little worthier of you that I was,—not much, but a little. And,  Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge  with Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in  this country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an  opportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I  knew your answer.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"  The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to  my native place and its neighbourhood before I got there. I found the  Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a  great change in the Boar’s demeanour.

Dickens,Great Expectations,"It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so  often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,  which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and  could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and  post-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as  in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and  the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.",evening arrive fatigue journey easily boar usual bedroom engage probably expectation assign indifferent chamber pigeon post chaise yard sound sleep lodging superior accommodation boar give quality dream good bedroom
Dickens,Great Expectations,"Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled  round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits  of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of  the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to  be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in  whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of  the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were  marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn  down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in  the dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open  gate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger  who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk walking on the  casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,  pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so  often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.",early morning breakfast get ready stroll round satis house print bill gate bit carpet hang window announce sale auction household furniture effects week house sell old building material pull lot mark whitewash knock knee letter brew house lot main building long shut lot mark part structure ivy tear room inscription trail low dust wither step moment open gate look uncomfortable air stranger business see auctioneer clerk walk cask tell information catalogue compiler pen hand temporary desk wheeled chair push tune old clem

We were not in a grand way of business, but we had  a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well.

But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept  the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the  clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted  that it would be necessary for them to part.

Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that  people ran about with flaring links, proffering their  services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct  them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,  whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down  at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became  invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the  clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if  its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.  The cold became intense. In the main street, at the  corner of the court, some labourers were repairing  the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,  round which a party of ragged men and boys were  gathered: warming their hands and winking their  eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug  being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,  and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness  of the shops where holly sprigs and berries  crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale  faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'  trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,  with which it was next to impossible to believe that  such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything  to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the  mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks  and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's  household should; and even the little tailor, whom he  had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for  being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up  to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean  wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.",fog darkness thicken people run flare link proffer service horse carriage conduct way ancient tower church gruff old bell peep slily scrooge gothic window wall invisible strike hour quarter cloud tremulous vibration tooth chatter frozen head cold intense main street corner court labourer repair gas pipe light great fire brazier round party ragged man boy gather warm hand wink eye blaze rapture water plug leave solitude overflowing sullenly congeal turn misanthropic ice brightness shop holly sprig berry crackle lamp heat window pale face ruddy pass poulterer grocer trade splendid joke glorious pageant impossible believe dull principle bargain sale lord mayor stronghold mighty mansion house give order cook butler christmas lord mayor household little tailor fine shilling previous monday drunk bloodthirsty street stir morrow pudding garret lean wife baby sally buy beef

He lived in  chambers which had once belonged to his deceased  partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a  lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so  little business to be, that one could scarcely help  fancying it must have run there when it was a young  house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,  and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough  now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but  Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.  The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew  its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.

Let it also be  borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one  thought on Marley, since his last mention of his  seven years' dead partner that afternoon.

It was not angry or ferocious, but looked  at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly  spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The  hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;  and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly  motionless.

There was plenty of width for that, and room  to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge  thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before  him in the gloom.

The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch  merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint  Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.  There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;  Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending  through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,  Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,  hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;  and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came  like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the  whole.

Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:  for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible  of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of  lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and  self-accusatory.

Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither  and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they  went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's  Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)  were linked together; none were free. Many had  been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He  had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white  waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to  its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist  a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,  upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,  clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in  human matters, and had lost the power for ever.",air fill phantom wander hither thither restless haste moan go wear chain like marley ghost guilty government link free personally know scrooge life familiar old ghost white waistcoat monstrous iron safe attach ankle cry piteously unable assist wretched woman infant see door step misery clearly seek interfere good human matter lose power

It was double-locked,  as he had locked it with his own hands, and  the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say ""Humbug!""  but stopped at the first syllable. And being,  from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues  of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or  the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of  the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to  bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the  instant.",scrooge close window examine door ghost enter double locked lock hand bolt undisturbed try humbug stop syllable emotion undergo fatigue day glimpse invisible world dull conversation ghost lateness hour need repose go straight bed undressing fall asleep instant

Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,  and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub  the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he  could see anything; and could see very little then. All he  could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely  cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,  and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been  if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the  world.

Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a  child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural  medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded  from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.  Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was  white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in  it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were  very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold  were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately  formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic  of the purest white; and round its waist was bound  a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held  a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular  contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed  with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,  that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear  jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was  doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a  great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.",strange figure like child like child like old man view supernatural medium give appearance have recede view diminish child proportion hair hang neck white age face wrinkle tender bloom skin arm long muscular hand hold uncommon strength leg foot delicately form like upper member bare wear tunic pure white round waist bind lustrous belt sheen beautiful hold branch fresh green holly hand singular contradiction wintry emblem dress trim summer flower strange thing crown head spring bright clear jet light visible doubtless occasion duller moment great extinguisher cap hold arm
Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing  steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt  sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,  and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so  the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a  thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,  now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a  body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible  in the dense gloom wherein they melted away.

It was a large house, but one of broken  fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls  were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their  gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;  and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.  Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for  entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open  doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,  cold, and vast.

In came all the young men and women employed in  the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the  baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,  the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was  suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying  to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who  was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.  In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,  some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;  in they all came, anyhow and everyhow.

Near to the winter  fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge  believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely  matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this  room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children  there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;  and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not  forty children conducting themselves like one, but every  child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences  were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;  on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,  and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to  mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands  most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of  them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I  wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that  braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little  shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to  save my life.

All this time, he lay  upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy  light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the  hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than  a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it  meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive  that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of  spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of  knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or  I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not  in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done  in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I  say, he began to think that the source and secret of this  ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,  on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.

Heaped up on the floor, to form  a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,  great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,  mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,  cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,  immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that  made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.

There were  ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in  the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking  from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went  by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were  pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there  were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence  to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might  water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy  and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among  the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered  leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting  off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great  compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and  beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after  dinner.

And at the  same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and  nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners  to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers  appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with  Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the  covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their  dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind  of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words  between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he  shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good  humour was restored directly.

Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical  family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a  Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who  could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never  swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face  over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and  played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:  you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had  been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the  boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of  Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the  things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he  softened more and more; and thought that if he could have  listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the  kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,  without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob  Marley.",tea music musical family know sing glee catch assure especially topper growl away bass like good swell large vein forehead red face scrooge niece play harp play tune simple little air mere learn whistle minute familiar child fetch scrooge boarding school remind ghost christmas past strain music sound thing ghost show come mind soften think listen year ago cultivate kindness life happiness hand resort sexton spade bury jacob marley
Dickens,A Christmas Carol,"But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After  a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children  sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its  mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first  a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I  no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he  had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done  thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the  Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after  that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the  credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,  tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,  smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,  there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.  He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up  against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would  have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would  have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly  have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.  She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.  But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her  silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got  her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his  conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to  know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her  head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by  pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain  about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told  him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in  office, they were so very confidential together, behind the  curtains.",devote evening music play forfeit good child well christmas mighty founder child stop game blind man buff course believe topper blind believe eye boot opinion thing scrooge nephew ghost christmas present know way go plump sister lace tucker outrage credulity human nature knock fire iron tumble chair bump piano smother curtain go go know plump sister catch anybody fall purpose feint endeavour seize affront understanding instantly sidle direction plump sister cry fair catch spite silken rustling rapid fluttering past get corner escape conduct execrable pretend know pretend necessary touch head dress assure identity press certain ring finger certain chain neck vile monstrous doubt tell opinion blind man office confidential curtain

But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her  love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.  Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was  very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat  her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper  could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,  young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for  wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that  his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with  his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;  for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut  in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in  his head to be.",scrooge niece blind man buff party comfortable large chair footstool snug corner ghost scrooge close join forfeit love love admiration letter alphabet likewise game great secret joy scrooge nephew beat sister hollow sharp girl topper tell people young old play scrooge wholly forget interest go voice sound ear come guess loud guess right sharp needle good whitechapel warrant cut eye sharp scrooge blunt take head
